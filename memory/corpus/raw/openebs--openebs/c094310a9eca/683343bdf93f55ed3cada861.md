# Roadmap

This Roadmap defines OpenEBS features and capabilities that are in current development and may be included in upcoming releases.<BR>
<BR>
Community and contributor involvement is vital for successfully implementing all desired items for each release. We hope that the items listed below will inspire further engagement from the community to keep OpenEBS progressing and shipping exciting and valuable features.

OpenEBS is a cloud-native persistent storage solution-provider for Kubernetes stateful workloads. OpenEBS offers 4 Local PV engines (Local PV Hostpath, Local PV ZFS, Local PV LVM and Local PV Rawfile), and 1 Replicated PV engine (Mayastor). The following roadmap includes features and enhancements for all the above engines.
_NOTE_: Local PV Rawfile is currently experimental. OpenEBS maintainers are seeking help from community to define the roadmap and take the sub-project forward.

## Near-term and long-term roadmap (2024 onwards)

Below table contains a list of both near-term and long-term backlog items. Near-term features are prioritized and planned to be completed within the next major release where precedence is given to usability, stability, resilience, data integrity issues reported by the community. The long-term features require significant design and development efforts, and will be scoped in the future.

OpenEBS follows a release cadence with a new minor release every 3-4 months.

_Note_: This document should not be construed as a binding commitment to delivery. Rather, its primary purpose is to provide insight into the project's intended objectives and strategic direction. The planned release timelines, version numbers and feature priorities are subject to change as the project maintainers/leadership/community continuously update and adjust in response to Kubernetes industry movements, trends and our community influence.

Please refer the GitHub project [OpenEBS Roadmap Tracking](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/projects/78) for the execution status of the roadmap items. The project also provides the release mapping and timelines for the issues and enhancement requests raised by the community.
