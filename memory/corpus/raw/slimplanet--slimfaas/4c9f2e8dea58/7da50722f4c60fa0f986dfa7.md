# Data temporary binary API

SlimFaas provides **temporary binary storage** through the **`/data/files`** endpoints.
This feature is designed for internal workflows (functions, jobs, agents, pipelines) that need to store and retrieve **binary artifacts** (PDF, ZIP, audio, PPTX, etc.) for a limited time.

This page explains:
- how to use the `/data/files` API,
- how it works internally (cluster behavior, safety limits),
- how to configure **Public vs Private** access and override it via **environment variables**.

---

## What is `/data/files` for?

Use `/data/files` when you need:

- a simple temporary store for binary artifacts
- a way to retrieve an artifact from any node in a SlimFaas cluster
- a solution that avoids shipping large binaries through the cluster’s consensus layer

**Core idea**
- The **binary content** is stored on **disk**.
- The **metadata** (checksum, size, content type, filename, TTL) is stored in a **cluster-consistent store** so every node knows “what exists”.

---

## Follow a temporary artifact

An upload returns an ID you can pass to a function or job. Consumers use that ID through the API; metadata is replicated through Raft, while binary bytes travel directly between nodes when needed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant A as SlimFaas node A
    participant Metadata as Replicated metadata
    participant B as SlimFaas node B
    participant Consumer as Function or job
    Producer->>A: POST /data/files?ttl=60000 with raw bytes
    A->>A: Store binary on disk
    A->>Metadata: Commit ID, checksum, size and expiration
    A-->>Producer: File ID
    Producer->>Consumer: Pass the file ID
    Consumer->>B: GET /data/files/id
    B->>Metadata: Check metadata and expiration
    opt Binary is not present on node B
        B->>A: Pull binary from an available peer
        A-->>B: Stream binary bytes
    end
    B-->>Consumer: Stream the file
    Note over Metadata,Consumer: After expiration or deletion, a lookup returns 404
```

The [file exercise](guided-tour.md#files) uploads the supplied fixture and compares the downloaded bytes. The dashboard shows traffic; use API responses to verify the file itself.

## API summary

Base path: `/data/files`

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/data/files?id={id?}&ttl={ms?}` | Store a binary artifact (request body = raw bytes) |
| `GET` | `/data/files/{id}` | Download an artifact (auto-pull from another node if missing locally) |
| `DELETE` | `/data/files/{id}` | Remove metadata and delete the local binary |
| `GET` | `/data/files` | List known artifacts (metadata-based) |

---

## Store an artifact: `POST /data/files`

### Request contract

- Body: **raw bytes** (not multipart/form-data)
- **`Content-Length` is recommended** (for accurate concurrency accounting)
- Recommended headers:
    - `Content-Type` (defaults to `application/octet-stream`)
    - `Content-Disposition` (to provide a download filename)

Query parameters:

- `id` (optional): artifact identifier
    - If omitted, SlimFaas generates an id.
    - Use URL-safe ids (letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, `-`).
- `ttl` (optional): time-to-live in **milliseconds**
    - Example: `ttl=600000` (10 minutes)

### Content-Length behavior (when missing or unknown)

SlimFaas streams the request body to disk. For its transfer safety guard (see **256 MiB parallel limiter**), SlimFaas normally relies on `Content-Length` to “reserve” the right byte budget.

If `Content-Length` is **missing** or **unknown** (e.g., chunked transfer encoding), SlimFaas:

- **accepts the upload**
- logs a **warning**
- reserves the full default transfer budget (**256 MiB**) so an unknown-size upload runs alone

> Recommendation
> Provide `Content-Length` whenever possible to get accurate concurrency behavior (especially behind proxies).

### Responses

- `200 OK` with the artifact id as plain text
- `400 Bad Request` if the id is invalid

### Examples (curl)

Store an artifact for 10 minutes and keep a filename:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/files?ttl=600000"   -H "Content-Type: application/pdf"   -H "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"report.pdf\""   --data-binary @./report.pdf
```

Store an artifact with a chosen id:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/files?id=my-artifact-001&ttl=300000"   -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"   --data-binary @./payload.bin
```

---

## Download an artifact: `GET /data/files/{id}`

### What happens on a download

When you request an artifact:

1. SlimFaas applies a Raft read barrier and reads the **cluster-consistent metadata** for `{id}` (checksum, size, content type, filename, TTL)
2. It checks whether the binary exists locally and matches the expected checksum
3. If missing, SlimFaas attempts to **pull** the binary from another cluster node that has it
4. The response streams the binary to the client

After a create or overwrite returns `200 OK`, a later download through any
healthy cluster node uses the latest committed metadata. A follower waits until
that metadata is applied locally instead of serving an older checksum.

### Responses

- `200 OK` streamed response
    - `Content-Type` from metadata (fallback `application/octet-stream`)
    - a download filename if provided at upload time
- `400 Bad Request` if id is invalid
- `404 Not Found` if metadata is missing/expired, or if no node can provide the binary
- `503 Service Unavailable` if the Raft quorum cannot guarantee a current metadata read

### Example (curl)

```bash
curl -L "http://<slimfaas>/data/files/my-artifact-001" -o my-artifact-001.bin
```

---

## Delete an artifact: `DELETE /data/files/{id}`

This removes the cluster-consistent **metadata** and immediately attempts to remove the
binary stored on the node handling the request. Other replicas remove their orphaned
copy after three cleanup observations (at most about 90 seconds with the default interval).

- `204 No Content` on success
- `400 Bad Request` if id is invalid

Physical cleanup is best-effort: the metadata deletion remains authoritative and a
background cleaner retries local orphan cleanup.

---

## List artifacts: `GET /data/files`

Returns the list of known artifact ids (metadata-based) and their expiration information (if any). Expired entries are not returned.

Example:

```bash
curl -s "http://<slimfaas>/data/files"
```

---

## Visibility & security (Public vs Private)

All `/data/files` routes are protected by a **data visibility** setting.

In `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Data": {
    "DefaultVisibility": "Private"
  }
}
```

### Behavior

- **Public**: anyone who can reach SlimFaas can call `/data/files`
- **Private** (recommended): only **internal** requests are allowed
  External requests are typically answered with **404 Not Found** (intentionally “hidden”).

---

## Overriding visibility via environment variables

SlimFaas supports standard configuration overrides via environment variables.

To override:

- `Data:DefaultVisibility`

Use:

- `Data__DefaultVisibility`

### Example: set `/data/files` to Public

#### Docker / Docker Compose

```bash
export Data__DefaultVisibility=Public
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment (excerpt)

```yaml
env:
  - name: Data__DefaultVisibility
    value: "Public"
```

To keep it private (explicit):

```yaml
env:
  - name: Data__DefaultVisibility
    value: "Private"
```

> Notes
> - This setting affects all data routes that are guarded by the same visibility filter, including `/data/files`.
> - Use `Public` / `Private` for clarity.

---

## How it works internally (high-level)

### 1) Metadata is cluster-consistent; content is disk-backed

For `/data/files`:

- **metadata** is stored in a cluster-consistent store so every node has the same view of what exists and how to serve it
- **binary content** is stored on disk on the node that received the POST request

This avoids moving large binaries through the cluster’s consensus layer.
Metadata reads are linearizable: followers synchronize to the leader's current
commit index before selecting the checksum to serve. Binary distribution remains
eventual; an on-demand pull supplies the committed version when it is not yet
present on the node handling the download.

### 2) Cluster distribution model: announce + pull

SlimFaas does not block the POST by pushing the binary to all nodes.

Instead:

1. The node that stored the artifact announces “I have `{id}` with checksum `{sha}`”
2. Other nodes can **pull** the artifact in the background
3. If a client requests an artifact from a node that doesn’t have it locally, that node can **pull on demand**

This yields eventual distribution with minimal upload latency.

### Diagrams (simplified)

#### Step 1: Post /data/files
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  %% 1) POST path — Upload + announce (fast)

  C[Client] -->|POST /data/files| A[Node A]
  A -->|write binary| D_A[(Disk on Node A)]
  A -->|"store metadata (id, sha, len, ttl...)"| M[(Cluster-consistent metadata)]
  A -->|announce id + sha| BUS[(Cluster announce bus)]

```
#### Step 2: Background announce handling
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  %% 2) Background distribution — announce → async queue → worker → pull

  BUS[(Cluster announce bus)] -->|event: id + sha| RX[Node B Listener]
  RX -->|enqueue announce| Q[(AnnounceQueue)]
  Q --> W[BackgroundPullWorker]
  W -->|"pull in background<br/>GET /cluster/files/{id}?sha=..."| P[Pull client]
  P -->|download from Node A| D_A[(Disk on Node A)]
  W -->|verify sha + write| D_B[(Disk on Node B)]

```
#### Step 3: Get /data/files/{id}
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  %% 3) GET path — Read local or pull on demand

  C[Client] -->|"GET /data/files/{id}"| X[Node B]
  X -->|read metadata| M[(Cluster-consistent metadata)]
  X --> HAS{Has file locally?}
  HAS -->|yes| D_B[(Disk on Node B)]
  HAS -->|no| P["Pull on demand<br/>GET /cluster/files/{id}?sha=..."]
  P -->|download from Node A| D_A[(Disk on Node A)]
  X -->|stream binary| C


```

## The 256 MiB parallel limiter (safety guard)

SlimFaas applies a safety guard that limits concurrent binary transfers to roughly:

- **256 MiB in parallel**

Meaning:

- each in-flight transfer reserves a “byte budget” equal to its size
- new transfers wait if starting them would exceed the budget
- a single artifact larger than 256 MiB can run only if it is **alone**

When `Content-Length` is missing/unknown, SlimFaas reserves the complete default
budget (**256 MiB**) and logs a warning.

**This is not a strict memory cap**; it’s a concurrency limiter.

---

## Storage & durability

`/data/files` is disk-backed:

- If storage is ephemeral, artifacts may disappear on pod restart.
- For durability, mount a persistent volume.
- Artifacts can be re-pulled from other nodes only while at least one node still has the content **and** metadata still exists.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Upload logs a warning about Content-Length
Your client/proxy sent the request without `Content-Length` (often chunked transfer).

SlimFaas still accepts the upload and reserves the full **256 MiB** default budget.
The upload runs alone by default. Provide a known length (e.g. `curl --data-binary @file`)
to allow safe parallel transfers.

### File transfer memory settings

The defaults can be overridden with `SlimData__Files__...` environment variables:

```json
{
  "SlimData": {
    "Files": {
      "MaxInFlightBytes": 268435456,
      "UnknownLengthReservationBytes": 268435456,
      "MaxPendingTransfers": 128,
      "QueueWaitTimeoutSeconds": 30,
      "DropPageCache": true
    }
  }
}
```

When the pending queue is full or a transfer waits longer than the configured timeout,
SlimFaas returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After: 1`.

### 404 Not Found on download
- metadata expired or was deleted
- no node currently has the binary (restart, cleanup, ephemeral storage)
- temporary unavailability during cluster convergence

---

## Quick reference

- Store: `POST /data/files?id={id?}&ttl={ms?}`
- Download: `GET /data/files/{id}`
- Delete: `DELETE /data/files/{id}`
- List: `GET /data/files`
- Visibility config: `Data:DefaultVisibility = Public | Private`
- Env override: `Data__DefaultVisibility=Public`

## Live metadata inventory

The built-in dashboard's **Live Stream → Data** tab shows file keys, TTL and document sizes without fetching values or documents. Search by prefix, inspect expiration and navigate pages of 100 entries. The inventory updates at the configured status interval; short-lived entries between snapshots may be missed.

Metadata follows the existing data visibility policy unless `SlimFaas__ExposeDataMetadata=true` explicitly enables metadata access for dashboard visitors. This does not grant access to stored contents. See [the dashboard inventory and SSE API](user-interface.md#data-inventory).
