# SlimFaas performance benchmarks

This document tracks the methodology and results of the micro-benchmarks used to
validate the performance commits of the `claude/performance-improvements-9h83ah` branch
(PR #313) and of its follow-ups (theme 6, branch `claude/slimdata-queue`).

## Infrastructure

- Project: `benchmarks/SlimFaas.Benchmarks` ([BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/)).
- Configuration: `Job.ShortRun` (3 warmups, 3 iterations) + in-process toolchain +
  `MemoryDiagnoser`. The goal is to compare a **before/after on the same machine in the
  same session**, not to produce publishable absolute numbers. Allocation gains
  (`Allocated` column) are exact; timings are indicative (a few % of variance).
- Running:

  ```bash
  dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/SlimFaas.Benchmarks -- --filter '*'
  dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/SlimFaas.Benchmarks -- --filter '*DeploymentsSnapshot*'
  ```

## Methodology

1. **Commit 0**: this infrastructure is introduced before any code change, and the
   full baseline is measured on the unmodified code.
2. For every performance commit:
   - non-regression tests are added whenever the existing suite does not cover the
     modified behavior (tests that document a behavior fix ship with the commit that
     fixes it);
   - the theme's benchmarks are run **before** (baseline) and **after** the change;
   - the commit is kept **only if a gain is measured**; the numbers are recorded here
     and in the commit message.

Two benchmark styles are used:

- **cross-commit before/after**: the benchmark calls the modified public API; the
  measurement at commit N-1 is compared with the one at commit N
  (e.g. `ReadDeployments`).
- **in-run A/B**: when the modified code cannot be reached in isolation (private path
  deep inside SlimDataService, dependent on a Raft cluster), the benchmark faithfully
  reproduces both strategies in the same run (e.g. `QueueCountBenchmarks`, which
  reproduces `DoListCountElementAsync` with and without materializing the message
  bodies).

## Coverage per theme

| Theme | Benchmark | Style |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Defensive snapshot copies (`ReplicasService.Deployments`, `JobService.Jobs`) | `DeploymentsSnapshotBenchmarks` | before/after |
| 2. Queue counting without body materialization | `QueueCountBenchmarks` | in-run A/B |
| 3. Per-HTTP-request allocations (port check, visibility, pod selection) | `HttpHotPathBenchmarks` | before/after (+ A/B for the port check) |
| 4. Recurring worker cost (NodaTime schedules, PromQL registry) | `SchedulingBenchmarks` | before/after |
| 5. Cost of one `PayloadBytes` evaluation (3× → 1× per snapshot) | `SlimDataStateBenchmarks` | unit cost × avoided calls |
| 6. SlimData queue commands applied by the Raft state machine (dequeue, HTTP callbacks, push) | `SlimDataQueueBenchmarks` | before/after |

## Results

_Machine: Linux x64 container, .NET SDK 10.0.1xx. Tables are copied from the
BenchmarkDotNet output of each step._

### Baseline (commit 0 — unmodified code)

Measurement environment:

```
BenchmarkDotNet v0.14.0, Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS (Noble Numbat)
Intel Xeon Processor 2.80GHz, 1 CPU, 4 logical and 4 physical cores
.NET SDK 10.0.110 — Job=ShortRun, Toolchain=InProcess, IterationCount=3
```

#### DeploymentsSnapshotBenchmarks (theme 1)

| Method          | Mean     | Allocated |
|---------------- |---------:|----------:|
| ReadDeployments | 84.52 ns |     376 B |
| SearchFunction  | 88.48 ns |     376 B |
| ReadJobs        | 82.76 ns |     240 B |

#### QueueCountBenchmarks (theme 2, in-run A/B)

| Method               | QueueDepth | Mean         | Allocated | Alloc Ratio |
|--------------------- |----------- |-------------:|----------:|------------:|
| MaterializeThenCount | 50         |   9,517.2 ns |  108656 B |       1.000 |
| CountOnly            | 50         |     408.4 ns |     848 B |       0.008 |
| MaterializeThenCount | 500        | 109,454.3 ns | 1084257 B |       1.000 |
| CountOnly            | 500        |   3,888.6 ns |    8048 B |       0.007 |

The production path currently uses the `MaterializeThenCount` strategy (every message
body is copied only for the caller to read `.Count`).

#### HttpHotPathBenchmarks (theme 3)

| Method                      | Mean       | Allocated |
|---------------------------- |-----------:|----------:|
| PortCheck_WithArrays        |  34.265 ns |     152 B |
| PortCheck_AllocationFree    |   1.401 ns |         - |
| ResolveVisibility_PathRules | 301.730 ns |     528 B |
| ProxyAcquireReleaseSync     | 581.602 ns |     320 B |

The global middleware currently uses the `PortCheck_WithArrays` variant.

#### SchedulingBenchmarks (theme 4)

| Method                    | Mean      | Allocated |
|-------------------------- |----------:|----------:|
| ScheduleLastTicks         | 21.273 µs |  46.42 KB |
| RegisterAlreadyKnownQuery |  2.159 µs |   1.29 KB |

`ScheduleLastTicks` is dominated by the `TzdbDateTimeZoneSource.ForId` resolution
repeated on every evaluation; called for every scheduled function on every 1 s tick.

#### SlimDataStateBenchmarks (theme 5)

| Method       | Mean     | Allocated |
|------------- |---------:|----------:|
| PayloadBytes | 43.45 µs |   3.92 KB |

`PersistAsync` currently evaluates `PayloadBytes` 3 times per Raft snapshot
(≈ 87 µs of avoidable state walking per snapshot on this test state).

### Commit "perf: return atomic snapshots instead of deep-copying on every access" (theme 1)

Non-regression tests: `SnapshotAccessRegressionTests` (+ existing
ReplicasService/JobService/Proxy suites — 64 tests green).

| Method          | Before (baseline)  | After              | Gain |
|---------------- |-------------------:|-------------------:|------|
| ReadDeployments | 84.52 ns / 376 B   |  0.95 ns / 0 B     | ~89× faster, zero allocation |
| SearchFunction  | 88.48 ns / 376 B   | 12.23 ns / 0 B     | ~7× faster, zero allocation |
| ReadJobs        | 82.76 ns / 240 B   |  1.11 ns / 0 B     | ~74× faster, zero allocation |

These properties are read several times per proxied HTTP request and up to ~100×/s
by the queue workers: the allocation savings translate directly into GC pressure.
**Measured gain → commit kept.**

---

### Commit "perf: count queue elements without materializing message bodies" (theme 2)

Non-regression tests: `QueueCountRegressionTests` (+ MetricsWorker, SlimJobsWorker,
QueueDispatchState, WebSocket, StatusStream — 34 tests green).

The production path switches from the `MaterializeThenCount` strategy to
`CountOnly` (in-run A/B benchmark, 2 KB payloads):

| Strategy             | QueueDepth | Mean         | Allocated | Ratio |
|--------------------- |----------- |-------------:|----------:|------:|
| MaterializeThenCount | 50         |   9,646.9 ns |  108624 B | 1.000 |
| **CountOnly**        | 50         |     379.3 ns |     848 B | 0.008 |
| MaterializeThenCount | 500        |  96,237.3 ns | 1084224 B | 1.000 |
| **CountOnly**        | 500        |   3,756.3 ns |    8048 B | 0.007 |

That is ~25× faster and ~128× fewer allocations per count. Callers:
MetricsWorker (also went from 3 reads to 1 per function per second),
SlimJobsWorker (duplicated read removed), the SSE status cache, and
WebSocketQueuesWorker (no longer reads the store when no connection exists).
**Measured gain → commit kept.**

### Commit "perf: cut per-request allocations on the HTTP proxy hot path" (theme 3)

Tests: SendClient, SyncFunctionEndpoint, FunctionEndpointsHelpers, Proxy,
EventEndpoint + PerfRegression suites — 102 tests green. The uppercase visibility
rule test (behavior fix) ships with this commit.

| Method                      | Before (baseline)   | After               | Gain |
|---------------------------- |--------------------:|--------------------:|------|
| ProxyAcquireReleaseSync     | 581.60 ns / 320 B   | 531.57 ns / 280 B   | −9 % time, −40 B/request |
| ResolveVisibility_PathRules | 301.73 ns / 528 B   | 260.75 ns / 528 B   | −13 % time¹ |
| Port check (production)     | 35.42 ns / 152 B (WithArrays) | 1.32 ns / 0 B (AllocationFree) | ~27× faster, zero allocation |

¹ The test path is already lowercase, so `ToLowerInvariant` benefited from the
allocation-free .NET fast path; for mixed-case paths the allocation gain adds to
the time gain. The header copies (request/response) and the publish-event loop
(20 ms poll → `Task.WhenAll`) cannot be micro-benchmarked in isolation (private
paths tied to HttpContext); they are covered by the endpoint tests.
**Measured gain → commit kept.**

### Commit "perf: reduce recurring work in periodic background services" (theme 4)

Non-regression tests: `ScheduleEvaluationRegressionTests`,
`ScheduleJobBackupSkipRegressionTests` (+ AutoScaler, RequestedMetricsRegistry,
ScheduleJobBackup, ReplicasScale — 81 tests green).

| Method                    | Before (baseline)   | After             | Gain |
|-------------------------- |--------------------:|------------------:|------|
| ScheduleLastTicks         | 21.273 µs / 46.42 KB | 409.07 ns / 592 B | ~52× faster, ~80× fewer allocations |
| RegisterAlreadyKnownQuery |  2.159 µs / 1.29 KB  |  42.50 ns / 0 B   | ~51× faster, zero allocation |

`ScheduleLastTicks` is called for every scheduled function on every 1 s tick of
the ScaleReplicasWorker; `RegisterFromQuery` for every trigger every 3 s.
The schedule-jobs backup now only serializes (base64 + JSON + SHA-256) when the
incremental hash of the raw data actually changed, and the activity-sync HTTP
client is no longer created/disposed every 2 s (not micro-benchmarkable in
isolation; covered by the tests).
**Measured gain → commit kept.**

### Commit "perf: trim SlimDataService read-path and snapshot overheads" (theme 5)

Tests: SlimData.Tests (SlimPersistentState, CommandBatch, Snapshot — 35 green) +
SlimFaas.Tests (SlimDataBatchMode, Retry, PerfRegression — 23 green).

This theme reduces **operation counts** rather than an independently benchmarkable
path; the gain is quantified from the measured unit cost:

| Saved operation | Measured unit cost | Avoided frequency |
|---|---:|---|
| `PayloadBytes` evaluation (full state walk) | 41–43 µs (test state: 200 KV + 400 hashset fields + 500 queue elements) | 2 out of 3 evaluations removed **per Raft snapshot** (+ 2 `GC.GetTotalMemory` probes when Information logging is disabled) |
| `GetRequiredService<SlimPersistentState>()` DI resolution | — | 1 per store read → 1 per instance |
| `HttpClient` created/disposed | — | 1 per batch flush (up to 1 every ~3-5 ms under load) → 1 per instance |
| `[1,1,1]` array | 48 B | 1 per store read → 0 (shared static array) |

The unit cost of `PayloadBytes` is unchanged after the commit (41.35 µs vs the
43.45 µs baseline — within the variance): it is the **number of evaluations** that
drops from 3 to 1 per snapshot, i.e. ≈ 85 µs of state walking saved per snapshot on
the test state (more on larger real states).
**Measured gain (operation count reduction × unit cost) → commit kept.**

### Commit "perf: single-pass queue dequeue and O(N + M) callback application" (theme 6)

Follow-up of the "SlimData queue data structure" item listed as future work in PR #313
(branch `claude/slimdata-queue`). Benchmarks and non-regression tests were added in a
preceding commit and measured on the unmodified code.

Tests: SlimData.Tests **194 green** (176 existing + 18 new in `SlimDataQueueCommandTests`,
all green before and after the change), SlimFaas.Tests **1073 green**.

Measurement environment (a different machine from the sections above — only the
before/after pairs of this section are comparable with each other):

```
BenchmarkDotNet v0.15.8, Windows 11 (10.0.26200), .NET SDK 10.0.302, .NET 10.0.10 X64 RyuJIT x86-64-v3
Intel Core i7-10750H CPU 2.60GHz, 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores
Job=ShortRunInProcess  InvocationCount=16  IterationCount=20  WarmupCount=5  DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0
```

The commands mutate queue elements in place, so every invocation consumes a pristine
state from a pool rebuilt in an unmeasured `[IterationSetup]`. A pool of 16 states keeps
the working set cache-resident (with 64+ fresh states per iteration the measurement was
dominated by cache misses and ±30 % variance). Tiered compilation is disabled because
each benchmark completes in ≈100 ms — before tier-1 code gets installed — so with
tiering on, the second benchmark of a run measured tier-0 code and the third tier-1.
Run with:

```bash
DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0 dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/SlimFaas.Benchmarks -- --filter '*SlimDataQueue*' --iterationCount 20 --warmupCount 5
```

**Design decision — the flat `ImmutableArray<QueueElement>` per key is kept.** A dequeue
has to visit every element anyway: whether an element is running, timed out or waiting
for a retry depends on the current time, so an id index or a tree structure would not
remove the O(N) scan, would slow down iteration, and would change the snapshot format.
What was wrong were the algorithms on top of the array, not the array.

| Method | QueueDepth | Before | After | Gain |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| ListRightPop (10 elements, mixed-state queue) | 50 | 3.10 µs / 3.97 KB | 1.88 µs / 1.95 KB | 1.6× faster, −51 % alloc |
| ListRightPop | 500 | 43.15 µs / 15.58 KB | 12.89 µs / 8.28 KB | **3.3× faster**, −47 % alloc |
| ListCallback (50 results) | 50 | 4.15 µs / 4.93 KB | 4.26 µs / 2.81 KB | time unchanged (within variance), −43 % alloc |
| ListCallback | 500 | 19.62 µs / 21.08 KB | 17.02 µs / 9.86 KB | −13 % time, −53 % alloc |
| ListCallbackBatch (50 results) | 50 | 9.44 µs / 23.82 KB | 3.43 µs / 2.81 KB | 2.8× faster, −88 % alloc |
| ListCallbackBatch | 500 | 93.19 µs / 375.41 KB | 16.84 µs / 9.86 KB | **5.5× faster, −97 % alloc** |
| ListLeftPushBatch (10 messages) | 50 | 9.24 µs / 10.03 KB | 7.54 µs / 9.65 KB | −18 % time |
| ListLeftPushBatch | 500 | 29.74 µs / 54.46 KB | 19.25 µs / 19.58 KB | 1.5× faster, −64 % alloc |

What changed:

- `QueueElementExtensions.GetState` classifies an element (Available / Running /
  WaitingForRetry / Finished) in **one evaluation**; the historical
  `IsFinished` → `IsRunning` → `IsWaitingForRetry` chain evaluated the timeout condition
  up to six times per element. `GetQueueAvailableElement` (the SlimFaas count path of
  theme 2) now relies on it.
- `DoListRightPopAsync`: **one pass** replaces five (timeout marking, finished selection,
  an O(N × F) reference-equality filter to drop the F finished elements, transaction-id
  scan, availability selection). The kept array is only rebuilt when an element is
  evicted, candidates are capped at `Count`, and the new try is appended with a single
  `ImmutableArray.Add` instead of a builder round-trip.
- `DoListCallbackAsync` / `DoListCallbackBatchAsync` share `ApplyCallbacks`: the M
  callbacks are indexed by identifier (allocation ∝ M, duplicates chained in command
  order) and the queue is walked once — **O(N + M)**. The batch command used to do a
  linear search per callback and a full `ToBuilder()` / `ToImmutable()` copy per
  eviction (O(N × M) time, one N-sized copy per evicted element — the 375 KB above).
- `DoListLeftPushBatchAsync`: new elements are appended with one `AddRange` instead of a
  builder copy followed by a `ToImmutable()` copy; the identifier set is pre-sized.

Side effect on theme 2 (`QueueCountBenchmarks.CountOnly`, the SlimFaas count path that
calls `GetQueueAvailableElement`), same environment and settings, `--filter '*QueueCount*'`:

| Method | QueueDepth | Before | After | Gain |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| CountOnly | 50 | 547.2 ns / 880 B | 329.8 ns / 880 B | 1.7× faster |
| CountOnly | 500 | 5,140.8 ns / 8080 B | 3,121.6 ns / 8080 B | 1.6× faster |

**Measured gain → commit kept.**
