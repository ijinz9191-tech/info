# SlimFaas Jobs


SlimFaas lets you run **one‑off, batch, and scheduled (cron) jobs** either on‑demand via simple HTTP calls or automatically on a cron‑like cadence. Each job definition includes guard‑rails: cap concurrency with `NumberParallelJob`, enforce per‑pod CPU & memory limits, and decide whether the endpoint is **Public** (external) or **Private** (in‑cluster). You get a powerful REST API while keeping your cluster safe from resource spikes.

## From a trigger to a completed job

HTTP requests and schedules feed the same job execution path. A job configuration supplies the executable/image, dependencies, concurrency and retry limits; it is distinct from each execution created from that configuration.

    Retry --> Running
    Result -->|"Retry budget exhausted"| Failed["Failed"]
    Succeeded --> Retention["Retain finished state until its configured TTL"]
    Failed --> Retention
```

In the dashboard, **Jobs Overview** shows configurations and running work. List executions with `GET /job/name` and create/delete your own schedules in the [job exercise](guided-tour.md#6-run-jobs-and-manage-schedules). CPU/memory resource limits depend on the orchestrator; native local processes do not enforce container limits.

### Recovery after a temporary SlimData interruption

An HTTP `202 Accepted` response means the job has been queued; execution still waits
for dependencies, an available concurrency slot and the cluster leader. A temporary
SlimData interruption can delay dispatch. Once the cluster can make progress again,
SlimFaas retries queue operations without requiring a node restart.

Queue reads wait at most five seconds per attempt for the committed Raft log to be
applied locally. An expiration is reported as a SlimData unavailability error and
retried; if those retries are exhausted, the jobs worker can try again on a later
cycle. Internal mutation requests keep their HTTP timeout active until the complete
response body arrives, including when the response headers have already arrived.
The default internal HTTP timeout is 100 seconds.

If a mutation response is lost or times out, SlimFaas retries the same ordered batch
against the current leader. Its producer, generation, sequence and request IDs are
preserved so SlimData can return the previously committed result without applying
the queue mutation twice. These transport retries are separate from retries of the
job program itself. This does not provide an exactly-once guarantee for external
side effects performed by a job.

If jobs remain queued after recovery, check dependency readiness, active jobs and
the node logs for `Raft local log application timed out` or
`Retrying the same ordered SlimData batch`. Retained `Succeeded` and `Failed` jobs
do not occupy concurrency slots.

## 1. Why Use Jobs?

* **Short‑lived or periodic tasks** — perform a specialised computation once or on a fixed cadence and then shut down.
* **Separate scaling** — jobs can have different concurrency settings from standard functions.
* **Infrastructure safety** — cap concurrent pods with `NumberParallelJob` and enforce per‑pod CPU/memory limits to protect your cluster.
* **Secure yet open API** — trigger jobs & schedules through REST, choosing **Public** visibility for external access or **Private** for in‑cluster only.
* **Dependency handling** — automatically wait for required deployments before launching.
* **Cost optimisation** — jobs and its dependencies run on‑demand and scale to zero when finished.
* **Built‑in scheduling** — declare cron schedules next to the job definition or create them on the fly with the API.

## 2. Defining Jobs via Configuration

You configure SlimFaas jobs by providing a JSON configuration. The most common method is to store this JSON in a
Kubernetes `ConfigMap` and pass it to SlimFaas via the `SlimFaas__JobsConfiguration` environment variable.

### Example `ConfigMap` + `StatefulSet`

Below is a comprehensive example showing **both** the job configuration and how it’s referenced in the SlimFaas `StatefulSet`:

### Explanation of Each Configuration Field

In `SlimFaas__JobsConfiguration`environment variable, you define jobs under the `"Configurations"` key and their schedules under the `"Schedules"` key. Here’s a breakdown of the configuration structure:

```json
{
  "Configurations": {
    "fibonacci": {
      "Image": "axaguildev/fibonacci-batch:latest",
      "ImagesWhitelist": ["axaguildev/fibonacci-batch:*"],
      "Resources": {
        "Requests": {
          "cpu": "400m",
          "memory": "400Mi"
        },
        "Limits": {
          "cpu": "400m",
          "memory": "400Mi"
        }
      },
      "DependsOn": ["fibonacci1"],
      "Environments": [],
      "BackoffLimit": 1,
      "Visibility": "Public",
      "NumberParallelJob": 2,
      "TtlSecondsAfterFinished": 36000,
      "RestartPolicy": "Never"
    }
  },
  "Schedules": {
      "fibonacci": [
          { "Schedule": "0 0 * * *", "Args": ["43"] },  # every day at midnight
          { "Schedule": "0 0 * * 0", "Args": ["43"] }   # every Sunday at midnight
      ]
  }
}
```

#### Configurations

You can define multiple jobs definition under the `"Configurations"` key. Each job has a unique name (e.g., `"fibonacci"`).
> **Warning**: These definitions are protections about actions you can do via API calls, such as triggering a job or creating a schedule. For example, we cannot ask for more resources than the ones defined in the job configuration. The same for the number of parallel jobs, the image used, etc.

| **Field**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Image**                   | The container image used to run the job (e.g., `axaguildev/fibonacci-batch:latest`).                                                                                                 |
| **ImagesWhitelist**         | Array of approved images. If left empty, only the specified **Image** is allowed.                                                                                                    |
| **Resources**               | CPU/memory *Requests* and *Limits* for the job pods. This helps ensure the job has enough resources and respects your cluster quotas.                                                |
| **DependsOn**               | A list of deployment or statefulset names that must be ready before this job can run. The job won’t start unless the listed dependencies have their minimum replicas up and running. |
| **Environments**            | Array of environment variables to inject into the job container (e.g., `[{ "name": "MY_ENV", "value": "someValue" }]`).                                                              |
| **BackoffLimit**            | How many retries are allowed if the job fails before considering it “failed.” (Equivalent to `spec.backoffLimit` in a Kubernetes Job resource.)                                      |
| **Visibility**              | Either **Public** or **Private**. If **Public**, the job can be triggered from anywhere (outside or inside the cluster). If **Private**, only from trusted pods or internal calls.   |
| **NumberParallelJob**       | Maximum concurrent executions for this job configuration. `Pending` and `Running` executions occupy slots; retained finished jobs do not.                                          |
| **TtlSecondsAfterFinished** | Time to keep the job resources around after completion (in seconds). For example, `36000` keeps them for 10 hours, after which Kubernetes cleans them up.                            |
| **RestartPolicy**           | The policy for restarting containers in a pod. Common values: `Never` (don’t restart), `OnFailure` (restart on failure).                                                             |


#### Schedules

You can also define **cron schedules** for jobs under the `"Schedules"` key. Each schedule entry contains:

```json
{
  "Schedules": {
    "fibonacci": [
      {
        "Schedule": "0 0 * * *",  # Every day at midnight
        "Args": ["42"]
      },
      {
        "Schedule": "0 0 * * 0",  # Every Sunday at midnight
        "Args": ["42"],
        "DependsOn": ["fibonacci2"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
| **Field**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schedule**   | A standard 5‑field cron expression (`m h dom mon dow`). See the [Kubernetes CronJob documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) for full details. |
| **Args**       | Arguments to pass to the job when it runs. Override default args defined in the job configuration.                                                                                         |
| **DependsOn**  | Optional list of dependencies that must be ready before the scheduled job runs. Override default dependencies defined in the job configuration.                                            |
| **Resources**   | Optional overrides for resource requests/limits, merging with the job configuration defaults.                                                                                              |
| **Environments** | Optional environment variables to inject into the job container, merging with the job configuration defaults.                                                                              |
| **BackoffLimit** | Optional override for the number of retries allowed if the job fails. Defaults to the job configuration value.                                                                             |
| **TtlSecondsAfterFinished** | Optional override for how long to keep job resources after completion. Defaults to the job configuration value.                                                                            |
| **RestartPolicy** | Optional override for the restart policy of the job pods. Defaults to the job configuration value.                                                                                         |

### Default configuration values

If you trigger a job whose name does not exist in `SlimFaas__JobsConfiguration`, SlimFaas falls back to a built‑in entry called `Default`. It ships with conservative resource requests/limits (`cpu: 100m`, `memory: 100Mi`), no dependencies, and the same visibility/retry defaults. You can customise these defaults by adding or overriding the `"Default"` key in your configuration map.

## 2.3 Defining Jobs from Kubernetes CronJob resources

SlimFaas can discover job definitions from Kubernetes CronJob resources when the CronJob carries the annotation:

```
SlimFaas/Job: "true"
```

When this annotation is present, SlimFaas's ExtractJobConfigurations scans the CronJob and converts parts of it into a SlimFaas job configuration (SlimfaasJob). Below you'll find the exact demo CronJob (from demo/deployment-cron.yaml) followed by a table showing how fields and annotations are mapped to SlimFaas configuration.

Example CronJob (exact content from demo/deployment-cron.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: fibonacci5
  namespace: slimfaas-demo
  annotations:
    SlimFaas/Job: "true"
    SlimFaas/DefaultVisibility: "Public"
    SlimFaas/NumberParallelJob: "1"
    SlimFaas/DependsOn: "fibonacci1,fibonacci2"
    SlimFaas/Schedules: '[{"Schedule":"0/2 * * * *","Args":["39"]}]'
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  suspend: true
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      backoffLimit: 1
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 60
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: fibonacci11
              image: axaguildev/fibonacci-batch:latest
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: "400m"
                  memory: "400Mi"
                limits:
                  cpu: "400m"
                  memory: "400Mi"
          restartPolicy: Never
```

| `spec.suspend`                                                  | _Required: must be `true`_      | Ensures SlimFaas manages scheduling; disables native Kubernetes scheduling                                  |

> **Note:** The CronJob's `suspend` field must be set to `true` for SlimFaas to consider it a valid job definition. This ensures SlimFaas manages the scheduling and triggering of the job, preventing Kubernetes from automatically creating Job resources outside of SlimFaas's control.

The native local manifest uses the same annotations under `jobs.<name>`:

```yaml
jobs:
  fibonacci5:
    command: ["dotnet", "run", "--project", "FibonacciBatch.csproj", "--"]
    workingDirectory: samples/FibonacciBatch
    annotations:
      SlimFaas/Job: "true"
      SlimFaas/DefaultVisibility: "Public"
      SlimFaas/NumberParallelJob: "1"
      SlimFaas/DependsOn: "fibonacci1,fibonacci2"
      SlimFaas/Schedules: '[{"Schedule":"*/2 * * * *","Args":["39"]}]'
```

In native local mode, `command` replaces the container image and the
Kubernetes Job-spec settings remain structural YAML fields. The old local
metadata fields `parallelism`, `visibility`, `dependsOn`, and `schedules` are
not aliases and are rejected.

### 2.3.1 Declaring Schedules via `SlimFaas/Schedules` Annotation

You can embed one or more cron schedules directly on the CronJob using the `SlimFaas/Schedules` annotation. Its value is a **JSON array** of schedule entries:

```yaml
annotations:
  SlimFaas/Job: "true"
  SlimFaas/Schedules: |
    [
      { "Schedule": "*/2 * * * *", "Args": ["39"] },  # every 2 minutes
      { "Schedule": "0 6 * * 1", "Args": ["99"], "DependsOn": ["fibonacci2"] }
    ]
```

  > **Note:** The schedule `*/2 * * * *` means the job will run every 2 minutes, every hour, every day.

Each entry is merged with the CronJob's own configuration, so fields you omit are **inherited** from the CronJob spec (image, resources, backoffLimit, ttlSecondsAfterFinished, restartPolicy, dependsOn, environments). Fields you provide explicitly override the inherited value.

| **Field**                   | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                  | **Default (if omitted)**                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
 | **Schedule**                | ✅ Yes        | Standard 5-field cron expression (`m h dom mon dow`). Example: `0/2 * * * *` runs every 2 minutes. | —                                           |
| **Args**                    | ✅ Yes        | Arguments passed to the job container at runtime.                                                | —                                           |
| **Image**                   | No           | Container image to use. Must be in `ImagesWhitelist` if set.                                     | Inherited from `containers[0].image`        |
| **BackoffLimit**            | No           | Number of retries before the job is considered failed.                                           | Inherited from `spec.jobTemplate.spec.backoffLimit` |
| **TtlSecondsAfterFinished** | No           | Seconds to retain finished job resources.                                                        | Inherited from `spec.jobTemplate.spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` |
| **RestartPolicy**           | No           | Container restart policy (`Never`, `OnFailure`).                                                 | Inherited from `spec.template.spec.restartPolicy` |
| **Resources**               | No           | CPU/memory requests and limits override.                                                         | Inherited from `containers[0].resources`    |
| **Environments**            | No           | Environment variables to inject.                                                                 | Inherited from `containers[0].env`          |
| **DependsOn**               | No           | Deployments/StatefulSets that must be ready before this schedule fires.                          | Inherited from `SlimFaas/DependsOn` annotation |

> **Tip:** Schedules declared via the `SlimFaas/Schedules` annotation are merged at synchronisation time with any schedules defined in `SlimFaas__JobsConfiguration`. This lets you keep recurring schedules close to the workload definition (in the CronJob manifest) while still being able to add dynamic schedules at runtime via the `/job-schedules` API.

## 3. Invoking **and Managing** Jobs

SlimFaas exposes HTTP endpoints to **trigger**, **list**, and **delete** jobs.

### 3.1 Triggering a Job

To **trigger** a job, make an HTTP request to the **job endpoint**:

```http
POST http://<slimfaas>/job/<jobName>
```

* `<jobName>` corresponds to the name defined in `"Configurations"` (e.g., `"fibonacci"` in the example).
The route has no arbitrary path suffix. Creation returns `202` with a JSON `Id`; use that ID when inspecting or deleting an execution.

**Example 1** (default parameters):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:30021/job/fibonacci \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"Args":["10"]}'
```

**Example 2** (overrides default configuration):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:30021/job/fibonacci \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"Args":["10"],"DependsOn":["fibonacci2"],"Resources":{"Requests":{"cpu":"200m","memory":"200Mi"},"Limits":{"cpu":"200m","memory":"200Mi"}},"BackoffLimit":1,"TtlSecondsAfterFinished":100,"RestartPolicy":"Never"}'
```

- SlimFaas merge parameters with the default configured value in `ConfigMap`
- SlimFaas checks if the job is configured and, if so, spawns a Kubernetes Job resource in `slimfaas-demo` (or whichever namespace you deployed SlimFaas to).
- If the job is **Public**, you can call it from anywhere.
- If the job is **Private**, SlimFaas verifies that the request originates from trusted pods or is internal to the cluster.


### 3.2 Listing Jobs

To **list jobs** (queued *and* already running/finished) for a queue or job family, send a `GET` request:

```http
GET http://<slimfaas>/job/<queueName>
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:30021/job/fibonacci
```

Example response:

```json
[
  { "Id": "1", "Name": "daisy-slimfaas-job-12772", "Status": "Queued",   "PositionInQueue": 1, "InQueueTimestamp": 1, "StartTimestamp": -1 },
  { "Id": "2", "Name": "daisy-slimfaas-job-12732", "Status": "Running",  "PositionInQueue": -1, "InQueueTimestamp": 1, "StartTimestamp": 1 }
]
```

| **Field**           | **Description**                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Id**              | Unique identifier returned by SlimFaas when the job was triggered.                                                                            |
| **Name**            | Kubernetes job name.                                                                                                                          |
| **Status**          | Current status. Possible values:<br>`Queued`, `Pending`, `Running`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `ImagePullBackOff`.                                |
| **PositionInQueue** | Integer position (1‑based) if the job is still in the queue. `-1` indicates that the job has already left the queue (Pending, Running, etc.). |

### 3.3 Deleting a Job

To **delete a job** *after* it has left the queue, send a `DELETE` request with the job name and job ID:

```http
DELETE http://<slimfaas>/job/<jobName>/{id}
```

| **Response**      | **Meaning**                                          |
|-------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **200 OK**        | Job resources and logs were successfully cleaned up. |
| **404 Not Found** | No job with the provided ID exists.                  |


---

## 4. Visibility: Public vs. Private

As with functions, you can mark jobs as **Public** or **Private**:

- **Public**: Accessible from outside the cluster (e.g., direct HTTP calls).
- **Private**: Accessible only from within the cluster or trusted pods.

Use the `Visibility` field in the job configuration:

```json
{
  "Visibility": "Public"
}
```

---


## 5 Managing Cron Schedules

SlimFaas ships with a companion API to create, list, and delete cron schedules at runtime.
The routes live under `/job-schedules`. Creation and deletion enforce the job configuration’s visibility. Listing dynamic schedules does not perform that same visibility check; control access at your gateway when needed.

| **Verb & Path**                        | **Description**                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /job-schedules/<jobName>`        | Add a new cron schedule for `<jobName>`.        |
| `GET  /job-schedules/<jobName>`        | List dynamic schedules stored for `<jobName>`. |
| `DELETE /job-schedules/<jobName>/{id}` | Delete schedule *Id* from `<jobName>`.          |

Request body for **`POST`**

```json
{
  "Schedule": "0 0 * * *",           // cron expression (required)
  "Args": ["42", "43"],             // optional
  "Image": "axaguildev/fibonacci-batch:1.0.1",  // optional — must be in ImagesWhitelist
  "DependsOn": ["fibonacci2"],
  "Resources": {                       // optional overrides
    "Requests": {"cpu": "200m", "memory": "200Mi"},
    "Limits":   {"cpu": "200m", "memory": "200Mi"}
  },
  "Environments": [],
  "BackoffLimit": 1,
  "TtlSecondsAfterFinished": 100,
  "RestartPolicy": "Never"
}
```

Only `Schedule` is mandatory. Any additional keys follow the same override/merge rules as a one-off job trigger. Creation returns `201 {"Id":"..."}`; the returned ID is not a numeric position in the list.

**Examples**

```bash
# Set BASE_URL to your demo; native local mode uses port 30020.
export BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:30021
SCHEDULE_ID=$(curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE_URL/job-schedules/fibonacci" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"Schedule":"0 0 * * *","Args":["10"]}' | jq -r .Id)
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/job-schedules/fibonacci"
curl -i -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/job-schedules/fibonacci/$SCHEDULE_ID"
```

> **Behaviour**
> At the scheduled time, SlimFaas triggers the job exactly as if you had called `POST /job/<jobName>` with the provided overrides. Dependency checks, visibility rules, and concurrency limits all apply identically for manual and scheduled executions.

### 5.1 Backup & Restore of Dynamic Schedules

Dynamic schedules (created at runtime via `POST /job-schedules`) are stored in the internal SlimData Raft database. Deleting Raft storage also deletes these schedules. Export the schedules before a planned storage reset; ordinary follower recovery should preserve storage.

To prevent data loss, SlimFaas can **automatically back up** all dynamic schedule data to a **separate volume** and **restore** it on cold start when the database is empty.

#### Enabling backup

Set the following environment variables. `SlimData__BackupDirectory` is required; `SlimData__BackupIntervalSeconds` is optional.

| **Environment Variable**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Default** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `SlimData__BackupDirectory`         | Directory path for schedule backup storage. When set, backup is enabled. When empty/unset, backup is disabled.                                                                    | `null`      |
| `SlimData__BackupIntervalSeconds`   | How often (in seconds) each node checks whether the schedule data has changed and writes a fresh backup. The file is only written when the content has actually changed (SHA-256 hash comparison). | `60`        |

#### How it works

1. **Periodic backup** — Every `BackupIntervalSeconds` seconds, each node reads all `ScheduleJob:*` hashsets from its local Raft state and computes a SHA-256 hash. The backup file (`schedule-jobs-backup.json`) is written to the backup directory **only when the hash differs** from the previous write, avoiding unnecessary I/O. All nodes perform this backup independently on their own volume.
2. **Startup sync** — When any node starts and the Raft state already contains schedule data (e.g., it joined an existing cluster), it immediately writes a backup before entering the periodic loop.
3. **Restore** — On cold start (`coldStart=true`) with an **empty** database, the **master node** checks the backup directory. If a non-empty backup file exists, it restores all schedule entries into the Raft cluster automatically.

> **Important**: The backup volume must be **separate** from the Raft database volume. This way, when you delete the Raft volumes to fix desynchronisation, the backup volume is preserved and the schedules can be restored on the next cold start.

#### Kubernetes example

```yaml
volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: slimfaas-volume        # Raft database
    spec:
      accessModes: [ ReadWriteOnce ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 2Gi
  - metadata:
      name: slimfaas-backup        # Schedule backup (separate volume)
    spec:
      accessModes: [ ReadWriteOnce ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

```yaml
env:
  - name: SlimData__Directory
    value: "/database"
  - name: SlimData__BackupDirectory
    value: "/backup"
  - name: SlimData__BackupIntervalSeconds
    value: "60"
volumeMounts:
  - name: slimfaas-volume
    mountPath: /database
  - name: slimfaas-backup
    mountPath: /backup
```

#### Docker Compose example

```yaml
services:
  slimfaas:
    environment:
      SlimData__Directory: "/database"
      SlimData__BackupDirectory: "/backup"
      SlimData__BackupIntervalSeconds: "60"
    volumes:
      - slimfaas_data:/database
      - slimfaas_backup:/backup

volumes:
  slimfaas_data:
  slimfaas_backup:
```

## 6. Visibility: Public vs. Private

As with functions, you can mark jobs **and their schedules** as **Public** or **Private**.

* **Public** — job triggers (manual *or* scheduled) can originate from outside the cluster.
* **Private** — only trusted pods or in‑cluster callers may trigger or create schedules.

Set the `Visibility` field inside `Configurations`.

---

## 7. Concurrency and Scaling

* `NumberParallelJob` limits concurrent executions for each job configuration.
  `Pending` and `Running` executions reserve slots, including jobs waiting for a
  retry. `Succeeded` and `Failed` executions release their slots on the next
  scheduler refresh, even while their resources are retained. The existing
  `ImagePullBackOff` exemption also applies.
* `TtlSecondsAfterFinished` controls how long finished resources remain available
  for inspection. A high TTL does not delay queued work or keep function
  dependencies awake. Finished jobs keep their terminal status in job listings
  until cleanup; lowering TTL is not required to free concurrency slots.
* In Kubernetes, terminal `Complete=True` and `Failed=True` conditions determine
  completion. Failed pod attempts or partial successes alone do not finish a job
  that is still executing or retrying.
* **BackoffLimit** controls total retries.
* SlimFaas manages creation, dependency checks, and honouring cron schedules without exceeding your limits.

To verify slot reuse with a one-hour TTL using native local mode:

```bash
dotnet build src/SlimFaas/SlimFaas.csproj
dotnet build samples/FibonacciBatch/FibonacciBatch.csproj
python3 tests/SlimFaas.Tests/Local/test_job_concurrency.py
```

The smoke test uses temporary state and free loopback ports. It completes four
executions at a parallel limit of four, then verifies a fifth succeeds within
60 seconds while the first four remain listed. It covers both retained successes
and retained failures, and stops its local supervisor when finished.

---

## 8. Summary

* **One‑off & batch jobs** — `POST /job/<jobName>`.
* **Cron (scheduled) jobs** — attach them inside `SlimFaas__JobsConfiguration > Schedules` **or** manage at runtime via `/job‑schedules` endpoints.
* **List** jobs: `GET /job/<queueName>`; **list** schedules: `GET /job‑schedules/<jobName>`.
* **Delete** a (running, waiting, finished) job: `DELETE /job/<jobName>/{id}`; **delete** a schedule: `DELETE /job‑schedules/<jobName>/{id}`.
* Visibility, overrides, resource limits, dependency checks, retries, and TTL behave **identically** for manual and scheduled executions.

Use **SlimFaas Jobs & Cron Schedules** to handle asynchronous, on‑demand, or recurring workloads with minimal operational overhead. Happy automating! 🚀
