# SlimFaas Functions (Sync & Async)

SlimFaas offers **two main ways** to invoke functions: **synchronous** and **asynchronous** HTTP calls.
Below is an overview of each.

---

## Follow an invocation

For a synchronous call, the caller keeps its connection open while SlimFaas waits for a ready replica and proxies the response. A wake-up can therefore be visible before the first successful response.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Gateway as SlimFaas proxy
    participant Orchestrator
    participant Function as HTTP function
    Caller->>Gateway: /function/name/path
    opt No ready replica
        Gateway->>Orchestrator: Request wake-up
        Orchestrator->>Function: Start replicas and check readiness
    end
    Gateway->>Function: Forward HTTP request
    Function-->>Gateway: Status, headers and response body
    Gateway-->>Caller: Stream the response
```

An asynchronous call separates durable acceptance from execution. A worker dispatches eligible work within the function's concurrency limits. Failed attempts can be retried; handlers must tolerate duplicate delivery.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Gateway as SlimFaas
    participant Queue as Durable queue
    participant Worker
    participant Function
    Caller->>Gateway: /async-function/name/path
    Gateway->>Queue: Enqueue and commit
    Queue-->>Gateway: Durable acceptance
    Gateway-->>Caller: 202 Accepted
    Worker->>Queue: Claim eligible work
    Worker->>Function: Dispatch when ready and capacity is available
    alt Handler completes during the HTTP call
        Function-->>Worker: Completion status
        Worker->>Queue: Complete or schedule a retry
    else Handler returns 202 for deferred completion
        Function-->>Worker: 202, work continues
        Function->>Gateway: Callback with the real element ID
        Gateway->>Queue: Complete or retry the outstanding item
    end
```

Watch both paths in the [Guided Tour](guided-tour.md#4-queue-work-retry-and-complete-callbacks), then [scale out with an async burst](guided-tour.md#scale-from-n-to-m-with-an-async-backlog).

## 1. Synchronous Functions

Synchronous calls block until the underlying function pod handles the request and returns a response.

- **Route**:
  `GET/POST/PUT/... http://<slimfaas>/function/<functionName>/<path>`

- **Example**:
  GET http://localhost:30021/function/fibonacci1/hello/guillaume → 200 (OK) with response from fibonacci1

If your function has scaled to zero, SlimFaas automatically **wakes it up** and waits until at least one replica is ready (subject to internal timeouts).

---

## 2. Asynchronous Functions

Asynchronous calls return HTTP 202 after durable acceptance, while SlimFaas queues the request and processes it in the background.

`202 Accepted` is returned only after the queue mutation is durably committed.
FIFO order, retries, and callback behavior are unchanged. For request bodies
larger than 1 MiB, SlimFaas durably commits and validates the offload metadata
before it enqueues the message that refers to that body.

- **Route**:
  `GET/POST/PUT/... http://<slimfaas>/async-function/<functionName>/<path>`

- **Example**:
  GET http://localhost:30021/async-function/fibonacci1/hello/guillaume → 202 (Accepted), handled in background
  Asynchronous mode also supports:

- **Limiting parallel requests** via annotations (e.g., `SlimFaas/NumberParallelRequest`).
- **Retry pattern** on timeouts or specific HTTP status codes.

Queue mutations wake the HTTP and WebSocket dispatch workers immediately after
their durable commit. `Workers:QueuesDelayMilliseconds` is therefore a maximum
fallback interval for a lost signal, a leadership transition, or a retry that
becomes eligible; it is no longer the normal queue polling latency. The local
SlimData wait for queue-critical mutations is controlled by
`SlimData:QueueLowLatencyEnabled` (default `true`) and
`SlimData:QueueMutationMaxWaitMilliseconds` (default `5`, range 0–225).

Bodies stored through the internal offload path are prepared concurrently with
a bounded parallelism, then dispatched in their original FIFO order. After a
non-retryable result has been durably committed to the queue, SlimFaas removes
its local file through a dedicated cleanup mailbox. This cleanup never blocks
dispatch of the next message and broadcasts a best-effort delete signal for
remote copies. Older or temporarily unavailable replicas fall back to the
existing convergent orphan cleaner. Raft metadata deletion stays outside the
dispatch mailbox and is grouped by the cleaner, so cleanup mutations cannot
delay every new queue write. A retryable status keeps every artifact available
for the next attempt.

---

## 3. Wake Function

You can explicitly “wake up” a function without invoking a specific route:

- **Route**:
  `POST http://<slimfaas>/wake-function/<functionName>`

- **Response**:
  `204 (No Content)`

This is handy if you want to ensure the function is running before real traffic arrives.

---

## 4. Listing Functions

SlimFaas exposes a route to check the readiness status of all registered functions:

- **Route**:
  `GET http://<slimfaas>/status-functions`

- **Response**:
  An array of objects with details like `NumberReady`, `NumberRequested`, `PodType`, `Visibility`, etc.

```json
[
    {
      "NumberReady": 1,
      "NumberRequested": 1,
      "PodType": "Deployment",
      "Visibility": "Public",
      "Name": "fibonacci1"
    }
]
```

## 5. Private vs. Public Functions

By default, functions are **Public** (accessible from anywhere). You can specify them as **Private**—restricting access to calls originating from within the same namespace.

```yaml
metadata:
    annotations:
        SlimFaas/DefaultVisibility: "Private"
        # or define paths:
        SlimFaas/PathsStartWithVisibility: "Private:/mypath,Public:/otherpath"
        SlimFaas/DefaultTrusted: "Trusted"
```
This helps you control which services can call certain endpoints.

`SlimFaas/PathsStartWithVisibility` rules are evaluated in their declared order. The first matching path prefix determines visibility; matching ignores case and an optional leading `/`. Rules that do not match are skipped silently. If no rule matches, `SlimFaas/DefaultVisibility` applies (Public when omitted).

The `Public:` and `Private:` prefixes are parsed when the configuration is loaded. In status responses, each rule therefore has separate `Path` and `Visibility` fields; the prefix is not part of `Path`. Event subscription visibility is configured separately through [`SlimFaas/SubscribeEvents`](events.md#1-subscribe-to-events).

An **Untrusted** function will be considered as outside the namespace and will not be able to access Private actions.  By default, a function is **Trusted**.

```yaml
metadata:
    annotations:
        SlimFaas/DefaultTrusted: "Trusted" # Trusted or Untrusted
```

### How callers are classified

A call is **internal** when the source address of its TCP connection is the address of a Trusted function pod or of a job pod. The comparison is exact (`10.0.0.1` never matches `10.0.0.10` or `110.0.0.1`), and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses compare equal to their IPv4 form.

The `X-Forwarded-For` header is **ignored by default**: a caller cannot become internal by forging it. If a reverse proxy sits between the callers and SlimFaas and must pass the original client address, declare it in `SlimFaas:TrustedProxies` (IP addresses or CIDR networks). SlimFaas then honours **one hop** of `X-Forwarded-For`, and only for connections coming from those proxies:

```yaml
env:
  - name: SlimFaas__TrustedProxies__0
    value: "10.0.0.5"          # a reverse proxy with a fixed address
  - name: SlimFaas__TrustedProxies__1
    value: "10.250.1.0/28"     # a subnet reserved for the ingress controller only
```

> **Warning.** `TrustedProxies` controls **authorization**, not just request attribution: every address in the list may declare any client address and therefore reach Private functions and peer endpoints on behalf of a Trusted pod. Declare only addresses owned exclusively by the proxy: its fixed IP, or a subnet that contains nothing but proxy instances. Never declare the whole pod CIDR (for example `10.244.0.0/16` on a common cluster network) or any subnet in which ordinary workloads can be scheduled; doing so reopens the header spoofing this check prevents.

Source addresses remain a weak identity: sidecars share the pod address, and a call that reaches a function pod without going through SlimFaas is not checked by SlimFaas. Use a NetworkPolicy to restrict the function ports to SlimFaas when that matters.

## 6. Function Configuration

You can configure the synchronous HTTP timeout and the retry policies used by asynchronous and publish calls with `SlimFaas/Configuration`:

```json
{
  "DefaultSync": {
    "HttpTimeout": 120
  },
  "DefaultAsync": {
    "HttpTimeout": 120,
    "TimeoutRetries": [2,4,8],
    "HttpStatusRetries": [500,502,503]
  },
  "DefaultPublish": {
    "HttpTimeout": 120,
    "TimeoutRetries": [2,4,8],
    "HttpStatusRetries": [500,502,503]
  }
}
```

Synchronous calls make exactly one HTTP request and never retry. `DefaultSync` therefore supports only `HttpTimeout`.

`TimeoutRetries` defines the delays in seconds between attempts for asynchronous and publish calls. `HttpStatusRetries` lists the HTTP statuses that trigger those retries.

Every section is optional. When a section or property is omitted, SlimFaas applies its defaults. For example, the following configuration customizes only publish calls; sync and async keep their default 120-second timeout, and async keeps its default retry policy:

```json
{
  "DefaultPublish": {
    "HttpTimeout": 15,
    "TimeoutRetries": [1,2,4],
    "HttpStatusRetries": [500,502,503]
  }
}
```

---

## 7. The DependsOn Annotation

You can also add a `DependsOn` annotation to specify that your function should wait for certain other pods to be ready before it scales up from zero. For example:

```yaml
metadata:
    annotations:
        SlimFaas/Function: "true"
        SlimFaas/ReplicasMin: "0"
        SlimFaas/ReplicasAtStart: "1"
        # ...
        SlimFaas/DependsOn: "mysql,fibonacci2"
```
- **mysql** and **fibonacci2** are the names of other deployments/statefulsets in the same namespace.
- SlimFaas will not scale the current function (e.g., `fibonacci1`) unless all pods listed in `DependsOn` are in a ready state and meet their own minimum replicas.

This is useful in scenarios where your function must not start until a database or another dependent function is confirmed running.

## 8. Scheduling Function Wake-Up and Scale-Down
If you want your function to automatically wake at a specific time or change its scale-down timeout based on the time of day, use the SlimFaas/Schedule annotation with a JSON configuration. This feature is especially useful for workloads with predictable peak/off-peak hours.

Example Annotation
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    SlimFaas/Schedule: >
      {
        "TimeZoneID": "Europe/Paris",
        "Default": {
          "WakeUp": ["07:00"],
          "ScaleDownTimeout": [
            { "Time": "07:00", "Value": 20 },
            { "Time": "21:00", "Value": 10 }
          ]
        }
      }
```

### Configuration Details
- `TimeZoneID`
Defines which IANA time zone to use (e.g., `"Europe/Paris"`).
You can see the full list of valid time zone IDs here: https://nodatime.org/TimeZones

- `WakeUp`
An array of times (`HH:mm`) at which the function should be woken up automatically.
For example, `"07:00"` means that each day at 07:00 local time, the function will scale to its `ReplicasAtStart` value (rather than remain at zero).

- `ScaleDownTimeout`
An array of objects containing:
    - `Time`: A local time string (e.g., `"07:00"`).
    - `Value`: The inactivity timeout (in seconds) that applies after this time.
      - For instance, `{"Time":"07:00","Value":20}` sets a 20-second inactivity timeout from 07:00 until another time checkpoint is reached.
      - `{"Time":"21:00","Value":10}` sets a 10-second inactivity timeout from 21:00 onward.

### How It Works
1. **At each specified time**, SlimFaas updates the function’s wake-up behavior or scale-down timeout in accordance with the schedule.
2. **Waking up** a function ensures at least one replica is running at that time.
3. **ScaleDownTimeout** adjusts how quickly the function is allowed to scale back to zero if there is no traffic.

### Example Use Case
- **07:00**: Wake up the function to be immediately available for peak morning traffic. The inactivity timeout becomes 20 seconds. If no traffic arrives for 20 seconds, the function could scale back to zero.
- **21:00**: Reduce the inactivity timeout to 10 seconds, allowing a quicker scale-down in the evening/off-peak period.

This scheduling feature helps you maintain availability during predictable high-demand periods while efficiently saving resources during low-demand times.


## 9. Key Annotations for Functions

Before you start calling functions, ensure you add the necessary annotations to your Kubernetes Deployments or StatefulSets:

- **`SlimFaas/Function: "true"`**
  Activates SlimFaas auto-scaling and routing for this pod. Without this annotation, SlimFaas will ignore the pod.

- **`SlimFaas/ReplicasMin: "0"`**
  The minimum number of replicas to maintain for the function. Setting `0` allows the function to scale down to zero after inactivity.

- **`SlimFaas/ReplicasAtStart: "1"`**
  The number of replicas to initially wake up to when traffic arrives or when manually woken. Typically set to `1`.

- **`SlimFaas/TimeoutSecondBeforeSetReplicasMin: "300"`**
  The number of **inactivity seconds** after which the function will scale down to `ReplicasMin`. (Default is often `300` seconds.)

- **`SlimFaas/NumberParallelRequest: "10"`**
  The maximum number of concurrent requests allowed for all replicas. Additional requests will queue until a slot frees up.

- **`SlimFaas/NumberParallelRequestPerPod: "10"`**:
  The maximum number of concurrent requests allowed per pod. Additional requests will queue until a slot frees up.


```yaml
# Example snippet from a Deployment
metadata:
    annotations:
        SlimFaas/Function: "true"
        SlimFaas/ReplicasMin: "0"
        SlimFaas/ReplicasAtStart: "1"
        SlimFaas/TimeoutSecondBeforeSetReplicasMin: "300"
        SlimFaas/NumberParallelRequest: "10"
        SlimFaas/NumberParallelRequestPerPod: "10"
```

## 10. Asynchronous Function Execution: Control Callback Mode

SlimFaas  supports **asynchronous function execution**, allowing a function pod to take control of when the final result is returned.
This pattern is well suited for long-running tasks, external system calls, or workflows that cannot complete immediately.

### How It Works

1. The client (or another service) sends a request to SlimFaas:
   ```http
   POST /async-function/<function-name>/<path>
   ```

2. SlimFaas forwards the request to the function pod and attaches multiple headers:
   ```http
   SlimFaas-Element-Id: <generated-id>
   Slimfaas-Last-Try: true|false
   SlimFaas-Try-Number: <attempt-number>
   ```

   These headers provide important context to the function:
   - **`SlimFaas-Element-Id`**: Unique identifier for this execution instance
   - **`Slimfaas-Last-Try`**: Boolean (lowercase string) indicating if this is the final retry attempt (`"true"` or `"false"`)
   - **`SlimFaas-Try-Number`**: Zero-based attempt number (e.g., `"0"` for first attempt, `"1"` for first retry, etc.)

3. If the function wants to run control the callback, it must explicitly:
    - **Return `HTTP 202 Accepted`** instead of a final result.
    - Take responsibility for sending a **callback** when the result is ready.

   Returning **202** is the key trigger that enables callback mode.

4. When the function completes its work:
    - On success:
      ```http
      POST /async-function-callback/<function-name>/<SlimFaas-Element-Id>/success
      ```

    - On failure:
      ```http
      POST /async-function-callback/<function-name>/<SlimFaas-Element-Id>/error
      ```

5. If the timeout configured in SlimFaas expires before any callback is received, the execution is marked as **failed**.

### Sequence Example

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant SlimFaas
    participant Function as Function Pod (e.g., Fibonacci)

    Client->>SlimFaas: POST /async-function/fibonacci
    SlimFaas->>Function: POST /fibonacci (with SlimFaas-Element-Id)
    Function-->>SlimFaas: HTTP 202 Accepted (async mode enabled)
    Note over Function: Function is now responsible for callback

    alt Success
        Function->>SlimFaas: POST /async-function-callback/fibonacci/<id>/success
        SlimFaas-->>Client: Final success response or notification
    else Error
        Function->>SlimFaas: POST /async-function-callback/fibonacci/<id>/error
        SlimFaas-->>Client: Error response or notification
    end

    SlimFaas-->>Client: Timeout if no callback received
```

### Key Points

| Element                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Returning HTTP 202**           | This explicitly activates asynchronous callback mode |
| **SlimFaas-Element-Id header**   | Allows the function to reference the execution instance in its callback |
| **Slimfaas-Last-Try header**     | Indicates if this is the final retry attempt (`"true"` or `"false"`) |
| **SlimFaas-Try-Number header**   | Shows the current attempt number (starts at `"0"`) |
| **Function controls completion** | The function decides when to send success/error notification |
| **Timeout handling**             | If no callback is received within the configured timeout, SlimFaas marks the execution as failed |

### HTTP Headers Sent to Functions

SlimFaas automatically injects the following headers when forwarding requests to your function pods:

#### SlimFaas-Element-Id
- **Type**: String (UUID)
- **Purpose**: Unique identifier for this specific execution instance
- **Usage**: Required when sending callbacks to SlimFaas
- **Example**: `SlimFaas-Element-Id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

#### Slimfaas-Last-Try
- **Type**: String (`"true"` or `"false"`)
- **Purpose**: Indicates whether this is the final retry attempt
- **Usage**: Helps functions adjust their behavior on the last attempt (e.g., send alerts, use fallback logic)
- **Example**:
  - First attempt: `Slimfaas-Last-Try: false`
  - After all retries exhausted: `Slimfaas-Last-Try: true`

#### SlimFaas-Try-Number
- **Type**: String (numeric)
- **Purpose**: Zero-based counter of the current attempt
- **Usage**: Track how many times the request has been retried
- **Examples**:
  - First attempt: `SlimFaas-Try-Number: 0`
  - First retry: `SlimFaas-Try-Number: 1`
  - Second retry: `SlimFaas-Try-Number: 2`

**Example in Function Code (C#)**:
```csharp
app.MapPost("/process", (HttpContext context) =>
{
    var elementId = context.Request.Headers["SlimFaas-Element-Id"].FirstOrDefault();
    var isLastTry = context.Request.Headers["Slimfaas-Last-Try"].FirstOrDefault() == "true";
    var tryNumber = int.Parse(context.Request.Headers["SlimFaas-Try-Number"].FirstOrDefault() ?? "0");

    if (isLastTry)
    {
        // Last attempt - maybe send an alert or use fallback logic
        logger.LogWarning("Final retry attempt {TryNumber} for {ElementId}", tryNumber, elementId);
    }

    // Process the request...

    return Results.Accepted();  // Enable callback mode
});
```

**Example in Function Code (Node.js)**:
```javascript
app.post('/process', (req, res) => {
    const elementId = req.headers['slimfaas-element-id'];
    const isLastTry = req.headers['slimfaas-last-try'] === 'true';
    const tryNumber = parseInt(req.headers['slimfaas-try-number'] || '0');

    if (isLastTry) {
        // Last attempt - adjust behavior accordingly
        console.warn(`Final retry attempt ${tryNumber} for ${elementId}`);
    }

    // Process the request...

    res.status(202).send();  // Enable callback mode
});
```

### When to Use

Choose this mode when your function:
- Performs long-running or deferred processing
- Depends on external systems (queues, schedulers, batching, GPU workloads, etc.)
- Should not block the client during execution
