# Data Sets API

SlimFaas provides a **Redis-like, cluster-consistent key/value store** through the `/data/sets` endpoints.

Use it to store **small values** (cache entries, JSON state, flags, checkpoints) with a robust replication protocol (SlimData + Raft).

- **Max payload size:** 1 MiB per entry
- **TTL unit:** milliseconds (`ttl` query parameter)
- **Atomic counters:** Redis-like `INCR`, `INCRBY`, `INCRBYFLOAT`, `DECR`, `DECRBY`

> Not for large file storage. For large binaries (PDF, ZIP, audio, PPTX, ...), use **Data Files**: https://slimfaas.dev/data-files

## Endpoints

Base path: `/data/sets`

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/data/sets/{id}?ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Create or overwrite a value with a caller-provided ID |
| `POST` | `/data/sets?id={id?}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Create or overwrite a value (legacy query-string form; generates an ID when omitted) |
| `POST` | `/data/sets/{id}/incr?ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Atomically increment an integer by 1 |
| `POST` | `/data/sets/{id}/incrby?by={long}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Atomically increment an integer by `by` |
| `POST` | `/data/sets/{id}/incrbyfloat?by={decimal}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Atomically increment a decimal value by `by` |
| `POST` | `/data/sets/{id}/decr?ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Atomically decrement an integer by 1 |
| `POST` | `/data/sets/{id}/decrby?by={long}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | Atomically decrement an integer by `by` |
| `GET` | `/data/sets/{id}` | Read a value |
| `GET` | `/data/sets` | List entries (IDs + expiration) |
| `DELETE` | `/data/sets/{id}` | Delete a value |

### IDs

- IDs are validated server-side (`IdValidator.IsSafeId`).
- Valid IDs contain 1 to 200 characters: letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`.
- If `id` is omitted (or empty), SlimFaas generates one (`Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N")`) and returns it.

### TTL (milliseconds)

- `ttl` is optional and expressed in **milliseconds**.
- When provided, the entry auto-expires after the TTL.

Examples:
- `ttl=60000` → 1 minute
- `ttl=600000` → 10 minutes

---

## Create / overwrite

`POST /data/sets/{id}?ttl={ttl_ms?}`

- Body is stored as raw bytes.
- Payload larger than 1 MiB returns **413 Payload Too Large**.

Examples:

Store JSON with a fixed id:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/my-usecase.session-123.state" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary '{"step":"route","chosen":"kb_rag","confidence":0.92}'
```

Store a string:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/my-usecase.session-123.flag" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data-binary "ready"
```

Let SlimFaas generate the id:
```bash
ID=$(curl -fsS -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets" --data-binary "hello" | jq -r .)
echo "created id=$ID"
```

Store with TTL (10 minutes = 600000 ms):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/my-usecase.session-123.state?ttl=600000" \
  --data-binary "temporary"
```

## Why an atomic counter matters

Incrementing with one API call avoids a client-side read/modify/write race. Concurrent successful increments are applied as individual replicated mutations; each response contains the resulting value. A network failure can leave a client unsure whether its mutation committed, so blindly retrying increments can count twice.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Client A
    participant B as Client B
    participant Store as SlimData committed counter
    Note over Store: Counter starts at 0
    A->>Store: POST /data/sets/count/incr
    B->>Store: POST /data/sets/count/incr
    Note over Store: Mutations are applied in committed order
    Store-->>A: 1 if A commits first
    Store-->>B: 2 if B commits second
    Note over A,B: The opposite arrival order is also possible
```

Try the [values, TTL and counters exercise](guided-tour.md#7-store-values-counters-hashsets-and-files). Verify stored contents through the API; the dashboard has no data explorer.

## Atomic counters

Counter operations are executed directly inside the SlimData Raft command. This avoids client-side read/modify/write races: concurrent increments are serialized by the Raft log and each request receives the value produced by its own command.

Supported operations:

| Command | HTTP endpoint | Stored value type | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INCR` | `POST /data/sets/{id}/incr?ttl={ttl_ms?}` | UTF-8 integer | new integer value |
| `INCRBY` | `POST /data/sets/{id}/incrby?by={long}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | UTF-8 integer | new integer value |
| `INCRBYFLOAT` | `POST /data/sets/{id}/incrbyfloat?by={decimal}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | UTF-8 decimal | new decimal value |
| `DECR` | `POST /data/sets/{id}/decr?ttl={ttl_ms?}` | UTF-8 integer | new integer value |
| `DECRBY` | `POST /data/sets/{id}/decrby?by={long}&ttl={ttl_ms?}` | UTF-8 integer | new integer value |

Rules:

- Missing or expired keys start from `0`.
- Integer commands require the existing value to be a strict UTF-8 integer.
- `INCRBYFLOAT` requires the existing value to be a strict UTF-8 decimal number.
- When `ttl` is omitted, numeric mutations **preserve** the existing TTL. Keys without an existing TTL stay without one.
- When `ttl > 0` is provided (milliseconds), it **applies or overrides** the TTL on the key — even if the key had none, or the key was created by this very command.
- `ttl <= 0` (or otherwise invalid) returns **400 Bad Request** without mutating the stored value.
- If a key has expired, the old value and TTL are ignored and removed before applying the mutation. A `ttl` provided on the request is still applied to the new value.
- Invalid numeric values or integer overflows return **409 Conflict** and do not mutate the stored value or its TTL.
- Responses are `text/plain` and contain the new value.

Examples:

Increment a counter:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/request-count/incr"
# 1
```

Increment by a custom amount:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/request-count/incrby?by=10"
# 11
```

Decrement:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/request-count/decr"
# 10
```

Increment a decimal value:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/cost-total/incrbyfloat?by=1.25"
# 1.25
```

Increment a counter and set its TTL to 60 seconds atomically:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/request-count/incr?ttl=60000"
# 1
```

Read the stored counter value:
```bash
curl -s "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/request-count"
# 10
```

## Read

`GET /data/sets/{id}`

- Returns raw bytes as `application/octet-stream`.
- `404 Not Found` when missing or expired.
- `503 Service Unavailable` when the Raft quorum cannot guarantee a current read.

Reads are linearizable. After a create or overwrite returns successfully, a
later `GET` through any healthy cluster node observes that committed value. A
follower applies a Raft read barrier and catches up to the leader's commit index
before reading its local state.

Examples:
```bash
curl -L "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/my-usecase.session-123.state" -o value.bin
```

If you stored JSON:
```bash
curl -s "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/my-usecase.session-123.state" | jq .
```

---

## List

`GET /data/sets`

Returns a JSON array:
```json
[
  { "id": "abc", "expireAtUtcTicks": -1 },
  { "id": "xyz", "expireAtUtcTicks": 638720123456789012 }
]
```

- `expireAtUtcTicks` is UTC DateTime ticks (100 ns units).
- `-1` means “no expiration”.

---

## Delete

`DELETE /data/sets/{id}`

- Returns **204 No Content**.

Example:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://<slimfaas>/data/sets/my-usecase.session-123.state"
```

---

## Visibility & security

`/data/sets` is protected by the same data visibility policy used by other data endpoints (`DataVisibilityEndpointFilter`).

`appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Data": {
    "DefaultVisibility": "Private"
  }
}
```

Env override:
- `Data:DefaultVisibility` → `Data__DefaultVisibility`

---

## Availability and backpressure

Writes are grouped into bounded adaptive batches before being replicated as Raft entries. Key/value reads use a bounded Raft read barrier. The API can return:

- **413 Payload Too Large** when one item exceeds the configured batch limit.
- **429 Too Many Requests** when the in-memory adaptive batch queue is full.
- **503 Service Unavailable** when no Raft quorum or valid leader lease is available within the bounded replication or read-barrier timeout.

The internal `/SlimData/CommandBatch` endpoint also returns **503** if leadership
is lost or a server operation is canceled while the caller remains connected.
Expected `NotLeaderException` and `QuorumUnreachableException` failures are logged
as temporary unavailability instead of unexpected server errors. **499** is
reserved for cancellation of the incoming HTTP request. If response headers were
already sent, the connection is aborted so a partial response cannot appear
successful. An unavailable or interrupted response does not establish whether a
write committed; the existing ordered producer-batch retry retains its sequence
and deduplication identity.

`SET` keeps its existing retry behavior. Numeric mutations are not retried automatically because they are not idempotent.

SlimData uses DotNext's `SharedMemory` WAL strategy by default. It keeps WAL chunks in memory-mapped files so the operating system can reclaim their pages under memory pressure. Deployments that explicitly favor maximum write throughput over memory usage can select `PrivateMemory` instead:

```bash
SlimData__WalMemoryManagement=PrivateMemory
```

Only `PrivateMemory` and `SharedMemory` are accepted, case-insensitively. An invalid value prevents startup. Switching strategy does not alter the WAL format and does not require a data migration.

Streaming state snapshots use a hybrid threshold. A snapshot is requested after 32 MiB of successfully applied WAL entries or 500 successfully applied entries, whichever occurs first. Both positive thresholds can be changed without altering the API:

```bash
SlimData__SnapshotIntervalEntries=500
SlimData__SnapshotIntervalBytes=33554432
```

The current byte window is exposed as `slimdata_wal_bytes_since_snapshot`. The one-hot gauge `slimdata_snapshot_last_trigger` reports the latest request cause with the `cause` label (`bytes`, `entries`, or `incompatible`).

The snapshot layout, the reserved pod IPs it persists for in-flight asynchronous requests and the compatibility rules between releases are described in [How SlimFaas works](how-it-works.md#snapshot-layout-and-reserved-pod-ips).

Raft membership changes are serialized and bounded by configurable timeouts. The announcement timeout must be greater than the membership change timeout:

```bash
SlimData__Membership__ChangeTimeoutSeconds=60
SlimData__Membership__AnnouncementTimeoutSeconds=70
SlimData__Membership__RemovalMissingCycles=3
```

Followers normally join by announcing themselves to the current leader. As a fallback, the leader also reconciles the Raft membership with the orchestrator topology. Missing members are added first; a member is removed only after it has been absent for `RemovalMissingCycles` consecutive reconciliation cycles. No removal is attempted when the orchestrator snapshot does not contain the local leader.

SlimData configures DotNext with `warmupRounds=10000` by default so a new follower can search far enough back in an active leader's WAL before requiring a snapshot. It can be overridden directly:

```bash
SlimData__WarmupRounds=20000
```

For backward compatibility, a `warmupRounds` value inside `SlimData__Configuration` takes precedence over this dedicated setting.

## Raft command protocol

SlimData writes and accepts only the `SLDC/1` Raft command envelope. Legacy payloads, including key/value command ID `2` and queue command ID `14`, are skipped without mutating the state; they are never converted or rewritten. Every node exposes its protocol and assembly version on the internal SlimData port:

Before a mutation is appended to Raft, every SlimData command is serialized into a bounded immutable payload. Its declared length and `SLDC/1` envelope are validated, then the same byte block is written to the leader WAL and replicated to followers.

```text
GET /SlimData/protocol
X-SlimData-Command-Protocol: SLDC/1
X-SlimData-Assembly-Version: <version>
```

A node with a missing or incompatible protocol is rejected during membership changes. The assembly version, including the Git commit SHA, is diagnostic only: different builds may coexist during a rolling update as long as both advertise the same command protocol. A temporarily unreachable follower does not make a leader incompatible while the Raft quorum and lease remain valid. A follower still returns `503` from `/ready` and refuses SlimData operations when its leader advertises an incompatible protocol.

Any release that changes the Raft wire format must also change `SlimDataCommandProtocol.Current` (for example from `SLDC/1` to `SLDC/2`). Such a release requires a coordinated cluster upgrade; releases retaining `SLDC/1` support normal one-pod-at-a-time Kubernetes updates.

Upgrading from a WAL created before `SLDC/1` requires a clean cluster restart:

1. Deploy one immutable image digest to all replicas.
2. Scale the StatefulSet to zero.
3. Delete the `slimfaas-volume-*` PVCs containing the `wal`, `db`, and `config` directories. Backup PVCs can be retained.
4. Start `slimfaas-0`, then the followers one at a time.
5. Verify the startup protocol/version log and ensure `slimdata_raft_skipped_command_total` remains zero.

The readiness endpoint returns `503` while the local snapshot is being restored, the node has no active Raft consensus, or the leader protocol is incompatible. The liveness endpoint remains available so Kubernetes or OpenShift can keep the process alive while the cluster recovers.

For a complete executable example covering values, expiration and every counter operation, follow the [Guided Tour](guided-tour.md#7-store-values-counters-hashsets-and-files). The [API Reference](api-reference.md#hashsets) also documents the separate hashset facade, its single-value body contract and its different visibility behavior.

## Live metadata inventory

The built-in dashboard's **Live Stream → Data** tab shows set keys and their TTL without fetching values or documents. Search by prefix, inspect expiration and navigate pages of 100 entries. The inventory updates at the configured status interval; short-lived entries between snapshots may be missed.

Metadata follows the existing data visibility policy unless `SlimFaas__ExposeDataMetadata=true` explicitly enables metadata access for dashboard visitors. This does not grant access to stored contents. See [the dashboard inventory and SSE API](user-interface.md#data-inventory).
