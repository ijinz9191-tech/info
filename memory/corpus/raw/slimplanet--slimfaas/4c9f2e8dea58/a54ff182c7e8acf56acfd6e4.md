# Agent Guidelines for SlimFaas Development

## 🎯 Overview

This document provides essential guidelines for AI agents (like GitHub Copilot) working on the **SlimFaas**, **SlimData**, **SlimFaasMcp**, and client packages. It covers compilation strategies, execution commands, testing procedures, and documentation requirements.

---

## 🗂️ Repository layout

- `src/`: the products only — `SlimFaas`, `SlimData`, `SlimFaasMcp`, `SlimFaasKafka`, plus the `SlimFaasPlanetSaver` npm package and the `SlimFaasSite` documentation site.
- `samples/`: demo and non-regression workloads used by the docs, the Docker Compose tours, the local demos and the CI images — `Fibonacci`, `FibonacciBatch`, `FibonacciKafkaListener`, `FibonacciKafkaProducer`, `FibonacciReact`, `CalculatorApi`, `GmailMailerApi`, `ConsoleApp1`.
- `benchmarks/`: `SlimFaasBenchmark` (the HTTP load and comparison runner used by `.bin/slimfaas-local-*.sh` and the perf-regression tests) and `SlimFaas.Benchmarks` (BenchmarkDotNet micro-benchmarks).
- `tests/`, `tools/`, `client/`, `docs/`, `demo/`: test projects, developer tools, client SDKs, documentation and Compose demos.
- Every .NET Docker image is built with the repository root as build context (`docker build -f <path>/Dockerfile .`), so `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `.editorconfig` and `eng/` apply inside the image build exactly as on a developer machine.

## 📦 Core Technologies

### SlimFaas, SlimData & SlimFaasMcp: AOT Compilation

**SlimFaas, SlimData, and SlimFaasMcp are compiled using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation**, a .NET feature that compiles IL code directly to native machine code at build time.

#### Why AOT?

- **Slim Footprint**: Reduced binary size and memory usage
- **Faster Startup**: No JIT compilation overhead
- **Production Ready**: Ideal for containerized FaaS workloads
- **Cold-start Optimization**: Functions wake up instantly from scale-to-zero

#### AOT Configuration

The native .NET services below have `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` in their `.csproj` files:

- **SlimFaas** (`src/SlimFaas/SlimFaas.csproj`):
  - Target Framework: `.NET 10.0`
  - Full trimming enabled
  - Symbols stripped
  - Unsafe blocks allowed for performance

- **SlimData** (`src/SlimData/SlimData.csproj`):
  - Target Framework: `.NET 10.0`
  - Optimization preference: Size
  - Full trimming enabled

- **SlimFaasMcp** (`src/SlimFaasMcp/SlimFaasMcp.csproj`):
  - Target Framework: `.NET 10.0`
  - Full trimming enabled
  - Symbols stripped
  - Builds `ClientApp` with `npm ci` and `npm run build` before build/publish

#### Important AOT Considerations

- **Reflection Limitations**: Minimize runtime reflection; use code generation where needed
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all types used in serialization are discoverable at compile time
- **Native Dependencies**: Be careful with P/Invoke calls; verify they work across platforms
- **Dependencies**: Only use NuGet packages with AOT support (e.g., `KubernetesClient.Aot`, `MemoryPack`, `prometheus-net`)
- **Source-generated serialization**: Add new JSON payloads to existing `JsonSerializerContext` partials (for example `src/SlimFaasMcp/AppJsonContext.cs` or `src/SlimFaas/Local/ProcessControlContracts.cs`) and keep SlimData command payloads `MemoryPackable`.

### Build quality: warnings are errors, all analyzers are on

`Directory.Build.props` at the repository root applies to every project (including `client/dotnet/SlimFaasClient`, `tools/` and `benchmarks/`):

- `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true` and `CodeAnalysisTreatWarningsAsErrors=true`: any compiler, NuGet restore, analyzer or trim/AOT warning fails the build.
- `AnalysisLevel=latest-all` and `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild=true`: every .NET code-quality rule of the current SDK plus the `.editorconfig` code-style rules run at build time.
- `Directory.Build.targets` turns on `IsAotCompatible` and the trim/AOT/single-file analyzers for every project that publishes with `PublishAot` or `PublishTrimmed`, so IL2xxx/IL3xxx diagnostics show up at `dotnet build`, not only at publish.
- `Directory.Packages.props` holds every NuGet version (Central Package Management, `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally=true`). A csproj declares `<PackageReference Include="X" />` with no `Version` attribute; restore fails on a version left in a csproj (NU1008) or on a package with no central entry (NU1010). `CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled=true` lets a vulnerable transitive package be pinned from the central file without adding a direct reference.
- `NuGetAuditMode=all` with `NuGetAuditLevel=low`: restore audits direct and transitive packages against the NuGet vulnerability database and any hit (NU1901-NU1904) is an error. Fix it by bumping the package in `Directory.Packages.props`, or by adding a `PackageVersion` entry for the transitive package that pins a patched version.

Two files decide which rules apply:

- `.editorconfig` (root): the repository-wide policy. Every rule set to `none` there is a deliberate decision with a one-line reason. Add a rule there only with a justification.
- `eng/tests.globalconfig`: extra rules switched off for test projects only (`IsTestProject=true`).

Rules for new or modified code:

- New code must be clean under every rule.
- Do not use a project-wide `<NoWarn>`. A justified exception is scoped: `#pragma warning disable XXXX // reason` around the smallest block, `[SuppressMessage("...", "XXXX", Justification = "...")]` on the member, or a `.editorconfig` section for a folder.
- Per-project csproj files keep only what is specific to them (target framework, output type, package references, AOT switches). `Nullable`, `ImplicitUsings`, `LangVersion`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors` and the analyzer settings are inherited and must not be redeclared.
- Adding a NuGet package means one `<PackageVersion Include="X" Version="..." />` line in the matching group of `Directory.Packages.props` plus `<PackageReference Include="X" />` in the csproj. Never write a `Version` attribute on a `PackageReference`, and never use `VersionOverride`; every project shares one version of a package. Dependabot updates `Directory.Packages.props` only.
- Logging goes through `[LoggerMessage]` source-generated methods (CA1848). Each `Foo.cs` that logs has a `Foo.Log.cs` companion declaring `internal static partial class FooLog` with one extension method per message; add new messages there instead of calling `LogInformation("...", args)` directly, and wrap calls whose arguments are expensive to compute in `if (logger.IsEnabled(LogLevel.X))` (CA1873).

### Web UI styling: BEM is required

All web interfaces in this repository, including SlimFaasSite, the SlimFaas and SlimFaasMcp dashboards, Planet Saver and demo applications, must use BEM for new or modified application styles:

- Use `block`, `block__element`, `block--modifier` and `block__element--modifier`; keep the base class when applying a modifier.
- Use component-owned classes and explicit state modifiers. Update JSX, generated HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript selectors together.
- Organize SCSS by component. Keep presentation out of inline styles and avoid styling by IDs or unrelated ancestor structure.
- Global resets/tokens, typography scoped to a Markdown content block, and classes generated by third-party renderers (Mermaid, Highlight.js, etc.) are exceptions. Keep these exceptions narrowly scoped; do not rename library-owned classes.
- Preserve SlimFaas branding: the primary blue is `#0000ff`. Reuse the application's central color token.
- Verify responsive layout, keyboard navigation and dynamic content after class changes. Existing interfaces are migrated as they are changed; unrelated screens do not require a wholesale rewrite.

### Dependency License Compliance (CNCF/FOSSA)

Every dependency or lockfile change must comply with the [CNCF third-party license policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md) and pass the repository's FOSSA License Compliance check.

- Check direct and transitive dependencies after every upgrade. Do not rely only on the package's declared SPDX license: FOSSA can detect differently licensed vendored, generated, example, or test files inside a distribution.
- Do not add or upgrade to a version that FOSSA flags with a license outside the CNCF allowlist, including `GPL-2.0-only` or `GPL-3.0-only`, unless the CNCF Governing Board has granted an explicit exception.
- Prefer replacing a non-compliant dependency. When no suitable replacement exists, pin the highest version already validated by FOSSA with an explicit direct constraint and an explanatory comment so a future lockfile refresh cannot silently reintroduce the rejected release.
- Regenerate every affected lockfile, run the relevant build and test commands, and confirm the FOSSA License Compliance check passes on the pull request before merging.
- Record every temporary license-related version hold and its reason in the pull request summary so maintainers know when and why it may be revisited.

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: Version `10.0.103` or later (see `global.json`)
- **Node.js**: Version `24` or later (for UI/dashboard builds)
- **pnpm**: Version `10.14.0` is used by CI for `src/SlimFaasSite` and `src/SlimFaasPlanetSaver`
- **Python/UV**: Python `>=3.10` with `uv` for `client/python/slimfaas-client`
- **Docker** or **Podman** (optional, for containerized deployments)

### Building

```bash
# Build the entire solution
dotnet build

# Fast backend-only build (skip the embedded SlimFaas and SlimFaasMcp ClientApp builds)
dotnet build -p:SkipClientAppBuild=true

# Build with AOT compilation (creates native executable)
dotnet publish -c Release

# Build a specific project
dotnet build src/SlimFaas/SlimFaas.csproj

# Build the documentation site
(cd src/SlimFaasSite && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build)
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Run SlimFaas in development mode
dotnet run --project src/SlimFaas/SlimFaas.csproj

# Run with Kubernetes integration (requires k8s cluster)
dotnet run --project src/SlimFaas/SlimFaas.csproj

# Run examples
dotnet run --project samples/Fibonacci/Fibonacci.csproj
dotnet run --project samples/FibonacciBatch/FibonacciBatch.csproj

# Validate and run the native local demo (paths are relative to the src/SlimFaas launch profile)
dotnet run --project src/SlimFaas -- local validate -f ../../slimfaas.local.yaml
dotnet run --project src/SlimFaas -- local up -f ../../slimfaas.local.yaml
```

Use repeatable `-f` overlays such as `slimfaas.local.dev.yaml` or `slimfaas.local.debug.yaml`; `debugUrl` routes a function to an IDE process in native local mode.

### Standalone local demo release bundles

The precompiled tutorial bundles are built from the current checkout, keeping the
standard SlimFaas runtime archives available separately. Build prerequisites are
.NET 10, Node 24 and Python 3.11+; end users need none of those tools.

```bash
python3 .bin/package-local-demo.py --rid osx-arm64 --version local-check
python3 .bin/test-local-bundle.py artifacts/local-demo/SlimFaas-Local-osx-arm64.zip
python3 .bin/test-local-bundle-helpers.py
python3 .bin/test-install-local-demo.py
```

Use the RID matching the build host. The native release workflow builds and tests
all five supported RIDs. Bundle smoke tests run the native runtime and packaged
functions/jobs with an empty PATH. Changes to local manifests or sample workloads
must preserve the bundle overlay and its guided-tour/Bruno fixtures.
The readiness probe tolerates temporary connection failures during startup within
a bounded deadline; requests exercising functions and job mutations are not retried.
Cleanup tolerates HTTP 404 only after the smoke job's successful completion has
been observed, since demo retention and per-node job views can make it absent.

### Docker

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t slimfaas:latest .

# Run local Compose demo
docker-compose up

# Podman Compose on macOS
chmod +x ./run-podman-compose.sh
./run-podman-compose.sh up -d
```

  - Core SlimFaas functionality: HTTP proxy, workers, scaling logic
  - Metrics, replicas synchronization, history
  - Data handling and endpoints

- **SlimData.Tests** (`tests/SlimData.Tests/`)
  - Raft-based cluster consensus
  - Key-value operations
  - File-based persistence
  - Command serialization

- **SlimFaasMcp.Tests** (`tests/SlimFaasMcp.Tests/`)
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration tests

- **SlimFaasKafka.Tests** (`tests/SlimFaasKafka.Tests/`)
  - Kafka connector and lag monitoring

- **SlimFaasClient.Tests** (`client/dotnet/SlimFaasClient/tests/`)
  - .NET WebSocket client registration, async handling, sync streaming

  - Python WebSocket client behavior with `uv run pytest`

- **SlimFaasPlanetSaver tests** (`src/SlimFaasPlanetSaver/src/*.spec.jsx`)
  - JavaScript frontend helper behavior and coverage via Vitest

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
dotnet test

# Run with code coverage
dotnet test --collect "Code Coverage;Format=cobertura"

# Run specific test project
dotnet test tests/SlimFaas.Tests/SlimFaas.Tests.csproj

# Run specific test with verbose output
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=YourTestClass" --verbosity detailed

# Run .NET client tests
dotnet test client/dotnet/SlimFaasClient/tests/SlimFaasClient.Tests/SlimFaasClient.Tests.csproj

# Run Python client tests
(cd client/python/slimfaas-client && uv sync --extra dev && uv run pytest)

# Run SlimFaasPlanetSaver coverage (same package checked by CI)
(cd src/SlimFaasPlanetSaver && pnpm i --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run coverage)

# Watch mode (re-run on file changes)
dotnet watch test
```

### Code Coverage

Code coverage reports are generated during CI/CD and stored in `TestResults/` directories:

```bash
# View coverage (after test run)
open coveragereport/index.html
```

### Testing Best Practices

✅ **Always**:
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes
- Use meaningful test names (e.g., `WhenScalingUpWith_TenRequests_ShouldCreateNewReplicas()`)
- Mock external dependencies (Kubernetes API, HTTP calls)
- Test both success and failure paths
- Ensure tests are AOT-compatible (avoid reflection where possible)

❌ **Never**:
- Leave failing tests in the codebase
- Ignore test failures in CI/CD
- Write tests that depend on external services
- Use hardcoded delays instead of proper async/await patterns

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

### Golden Rule: Always Update Documentation

**Every code change that affects user-facing behavior, configuration, or architecture MUST be accompanied by documentation updates.**

### Documentation Files to Update

#### 1. **README.md** (Root)
Located at `/README.md`, this is the first impression:
- Update project description if scope changes
- Keep feature list current with new capabilities
- Update performance benchmarks if AOT compilation improves metrics
- Add/remove links to documentation sections as needed

#### 2. **Documentation Folder** (`./docs/`)
Public files registered in
`src/SlimFaasSite/src/lib/documentation-catalog.ts` are automatically
published to [slimfaas.dev](https://slimfaas.dev). Other files remain
technical references on GitHub.

- **`get-started.md`** – Deployment instructions
  - Add new deployment methods if available
  - Update prerequisites when SDK versions change
  - Include new environment variables

- **`native-local-mode.md`** – Native local CLI and process orchestration
  - Document `slimfaas local validate` / `slimfaas local up` behavior

  - Explain tool generation
  - Provide integration examples

### Documentation Format & Style

- **Markdown (.md)** – Use standard GitHub-flavored Markdown
- **Language** – Write short descriptions and documentation updates in English only
- **Code Examples** – Always include executable examples with language markers:
  ```bash
  # Shell commands
  dotnet test
  ```
  ```csharp
  // C# code
  var result = await function.InvokeAsync();
  ```
  ```json
  // JSON payloads
  {"function": "myFunc"}
  ```
- **Sections** – Use clear hierarchy: `# Title`, `## Section`, `### Subsection`
- **Cross-links** – Link to related documentation files
- **Images & Diagrams** – Store in `docs/` and use paths relative to the Markdown file

### Documentation Site Build

The documentation site is **automatically built and deployed** from `src/SlimFaasSite`:

- Sources: The checked-out `docs/` files and `README.md`
- Build Tool: Node.js + pnpm (see `.github/workflows/SiteBuild.yml` and the `deploy_website` job in `.github/workflows/main.yml`)
- Deployment: Published to https://slimfaas.dev
- No manual intervention needed; changes appear automatically
- Validate locally with `(cd src/SlimFaasSite && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build)`; a missing source in `src/SlimFaasSite/src/lib/documentation-catalog.ts` fails the build.

### Documentation Checklist

## 🛠️ Development Tips for Agents

### When Making Code Changes

1. **Preserve AOT Compatibility**
   - Avoid `Type.GetType()` and reflection-based lookups
   - Use dependency injection instead of service locators
   - Ensure serialization libraries support AOT (e.g., `MemoryPack`, not `Newtonsoft.Json`)

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   - Always: `dotnet test`
   - Verify no regressions in existing tests

3. **Update Documentation in Parallel**
   - Don't create orphaned documentation
   - Link new docs from `README.md` or related files
   - Test documentation examples

4. **Keep Demos Working**
   - If code changes affect user-facing configuration, sample workloads, ports, images, or annotations, update the matching demo files: `demo/deployment-*.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `slimfaas.local*.yaml`.
   - After runtime, configuration, function routing, data, queue, job, or UI changes, run the native local chain with `dotnet run --project src/SlimFaas -- local up -f ../../slimfaas.local.yaml` and verify `http://127.0.0.1:30020/status-functions` plus a demo function path such as `/function/fibonacci1/hello/local`.

5. **Consider Performance**
   - SlimFaas is designed for **slim footprint and fast execution**
   - Avoid large allocations; use pooling/streaming where possible
   - Profile impact on memory and startup time
   - For changes touching `src/SlimData/`, `src/SlimFaas/Data/`, batching, queues, metrics cardinality, HTTP client pooling, or high-throughput request paths, run the relevant performance tests: `.bin/slimdata-benchmark.sh`, `.bin/slimdata-batch-modes-benchmark.sh`, `.bin/memory-lab.sh`, or `dotnet run --project benchmarks/SlimFaasBenchmark/SlimFaasBenchmark.csproj`.

6. **Kubernetes-First Mindset**
   - Test with proper Kubernetes API interactions
   - Use annotations for configuration
   - Consider multi-pod scenarios (leader election, state sync)

7. **Keep WebSocket Clients and Runtime in Sync**
   - Runtime WebSocket code lives in `src/SlimFaas/WebSocket/`; official clients live in `client/dotnet/SlimFaasClient/` and `client/python/slimfaas-client/`.
   - If registration payloads, callbacks, or sync streaming change, update `docs/clients.md`, both client READMEs, and the relevant client tests.
   - `FunctionName` / `function_name` must not match an existing Kubernetes Deployment, and clients sharing the same name must use identical configuration.

8. **Validate Native Local Mode Changes**
   - CLI and manifest orchestration live under `src/SlimFaas/Local/`.
   - Validate with `dotnet run --project src/SlimFaas -- local validate -f ../../slimfaas.local.yaml` and use `slimfaas.local.debug.yaml` for `debugUrl` IDE routing scenarios.
