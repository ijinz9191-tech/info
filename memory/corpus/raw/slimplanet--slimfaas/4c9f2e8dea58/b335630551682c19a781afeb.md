# SlimFaas: The Slimmest, Simplest & Autoscaling-First Function-as-a-Service

<div align="center">

### Start exploring

Choose [Kubernetes](docs/get-started-kubernetes.md), [native local processes](docs/get-started-local.md), or [Docker Compose](docs/get-started-docker-compose.md). Open the built-in dashboard and follow the [Guided Tour](docs/guided-tour.md) with cURL or the [Bruno collection](demo/bruno-slimfaas-demo). Find all runtime routes in the [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md).

The [precompiled local demo](docs/get-started-local.md) packages the dashboard, functions and jobs without requiring a .NET or Node installation. It requires a release containing the new `SlimFaas-Local-*` bundles; source-based development remains available in [Local Mode](docs/native-local-mode.md).

## 🌥️ Proud CNCF Landscape Project

SlimFaas is part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io).

SlimFaas is a lightweight, plug-and-play Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform for Kubernetes, native local processes, Docker Compose and Podman Compose.
It’s designed to be **fast**, **simple**, and **extremely slim** — with a very opinionated, **autoscaling-first** design:
- `0 → N` wake-up from HTTP history & schedules,
- `0 → N` wake-up from **Kafka lag** via the companion **SlimFaas Kafka** service,
- `N → M` scaling powered by PromQL, plus opt-in `0 → N` wake-up from independent OpenMetrics exporters,
- internal metrics store, debug endpoints, and scale-to-zero out of the box.
- built-in **User Interface** at the SlimFaas root address to see functions, jobs, queues, and real-time messages.
- **[Scaling diagnostics and playground](docs/user-interface.md#scaling-diagnostics-and-playground)** to explain live decisions and preview changes without modifying production.
- temporary **Data Files** endpoints to ingest and stage binaries (from tiny to very large) with TTL-friendly storage — perfect for caching & agentic workflows.
- temporary **Data Sets** endpoints (`/data/sets`) to store small, Redis-like KV payloads (cache, JSON state, flags) with optional TTL — replicated through the cluster via a robust consensus layer.

## Why Use SlimFaas?

### 🚀 Autoscaling that actually understands your traffic

- **Scale-to-zero & wake-up**
    - Scale down to `0` after inactivity with configurable timeouts.
    - Wake up from `0 → N` based on real HTTP traffic and/or cron-like schedules.
    - Wake up from `0 → N` based on **Kafka topic activity**, using **SlimFaas Kafka** to monitor consumer lag and call the SlimFaas wake-up API.
    - Control initial capacity with `ReplicasAtStart` to reduce cold-start impact.

- **Two-phase scaling model**
    - **`0 → N`**: driven by HTTP history, schedules, **and Kafka lag (SlimFaas Kafka)** to bring functions online only when they’re needed.
    - **`N → M`**: driven by a built-in PromQL mini-evaluator on top of an internal metrics store.
    - Existing local-metric configurations run while pods exist; independent external sources can opt into wake-up with `ScaleFromZero: true`.

- **PromQL-driven autoscaler**
    - Express scaling rules with PromQL-style queries, for example:
        - `sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{namespace="...",job="..."}[1m]))`
        - `max_over_time(slimfaas_function_queue_ready_items{function="my-func"}[30s])`
        - `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le) ( rate(http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{...}[1m]) ))`
    - Choose whether thresholds are **per pod** (`AverageValue`) or **global** (`Value`).
    - Configure scale-up/scale-down policies and stabilization windows inspired by HPA/KEDA.

- **Integrated metrics scraping**
    - SlimFaas scrapes annotated pod endpoints and explicitly configured external HTTP/HTTPS OpenMetrics sources.
    - It stores only the **metric keys that are requested** in autoscaling triggers or debug queries.
    - A single designated node scrapes and persists metrics; all other nodes read from the same store.

- **Debug-friendly**
    - `POST /debug/promql/eval` – evaluate a PromQL expression against the internal store and see the scalar result.
    - `GET /debug/store` – inspect what metrics are being scraped, how many series exist, and retention size.
    - Designed so you can easily answer: *“What does SlimFaas see when it decides to scale?”*

- **FinOps-minded**
    - 30-minute metrics retention window for predictable memory usage.
    - Native scale-to-zero and schedules to keep non-critical workloads cold when they’re not needed.
    - Slim control-plane footprint to avoid burning resources in your autoscaling logic itself.

### 🧵 Synchronous and Asynchronous Functions

- Simple HTTP endpoints for both **sync** and **async** calls.
- Async mode:
    - Limit the number of concurrent requests per function.
    - Configure retry behaviors and backoff strategies.
    - Drive autoscaling decisions from queue metrics.

### ⏱ Jobs

- Run **one-off**, **batch**, and **scheduled (cron)** jobs via HTTP calls.
- Configure:
    - concurrency,
    - visibility (public/private),
    - retry behavior.

### 🔐 Private/Public Functions and Jobs

- Mark functions as **public** or **private**:
    - Private: only accessible from within the cluster or from trusted pods.
    - Public: fronted by Ingress / API Gateways as usual.

### 📣 Publish/Subscribe Internal Events

- Synchronously send events to **every replica** of selected functions.
- No additional event bus required — ideal for cluster-local fan-out, cache invalidation, configuration refresh, etc.

### 🧰 Data Files & Data Sets (real-time ingestion + ephemeral caching + robust KV)

SlimFaas includes two complementary “data” APIs:

#### 📁 Data Files (temporary binary artifacts)

**Data Files** endpoints are designed to **stream, store, and serve temporary files** — from tiny payloads to *very large* binaries.
Ideal for **agentic workflows** and **real-time ingestion**: upload once, get an `id`, then let tools/functions consume it when they’re ready.

- Stream-first uploads (without buffering in memory or disk)
- **Agentic-ready** attachments & multi-step flows
- **Ephemeral caching** for intermediate artifacts
- **TTL-based** lifecycle (auto-expiration)

#### 🧠 Data Sets (Redis-like KV for small state)

**Data Sets** endpoints provide a **small, Redis-like KV store** (raw bytes) replicated across the SlimFaas cluster.

- Stream-first uploads
- Store **anything small**: JSON, strings, flags, lightweight cache entries
- Optional `ttl` in **milliseconds** (auto-expiration)
- Hard limit: **1 MiB per value**

### 🧠 “Mind Changer” (Status & Wake-up API)

- Built-in REST APIs to:
    - monitor function and replica status,
    - wake functions up on demand,
    - integrate autoscaling state into your own tools/dashboards.

### 🔌 Plug and Play

- Deploy SlimFaas as a standard pod/StatefulSet with minimal configuration.
- Onboard existing workloads simply by adding annotations:
    - let SlimFaas manage their scaling without rewriting your applications.

### ⚡ Slim & Fast

- Written in .NET with:
    - focus on performance and low memory footprint,
    - AOT-friendly design,
    - minimal dependency surface.

### Live operational dashboard

The embedded [SlimFaas dashboard](docs/user-interface.md) pairs a compact infrastructure overview with a zoomable canvas traffic map for jobs, replicas and functions. Its Data tab streams keys, TTL and file sizes without reading stored contents. Traffic identifies the Raft leader and each visible replica destination; an opt-in log viewer follows managed functions, jobs and SlimFaas nodes with bounded, filterable output.


### External metrics autoscaling

Scale running functions from independent Prometheus/OpenMetrics exporters and optionally
wake them from zero with `SlimFaas/Scale.ScaleFromZero: true`. Existing annotations keep
their behavior. See [configuration and rollout](docs/autoscaling.md#external-metrics-and-opt-in-wake-up)
and the [native/Kubernetes exporter demo](demo/external-autoscaling/README.md).
